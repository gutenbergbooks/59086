<h2>
EDITOR’S PREFACE.
</h2>

<p class="post">
When my friend asked me to read through these
reminiscences in their original form, with a view to
editing them, I had to tell him at the outset that the
remoteness of the retrospect might probably prove a
serious obstacle.
</p>

<p>
But, being neither a history nor geography, and
dealing lightly with a number of topics that should
be of interest to many Englishmen, it soon occurred to
me that they might perhaps find readers in spite of not
being up to date.
</p>

<p>
It is the fashion nowadays—and it seems to me a somewhat
injudicious practice—to publish the record of one’s
travels and experiences within a few weeks after returning
home, whereas many opinions that the writer
would naturally hold while still under the unsettling
influence of travel, might be at least very considerably
modified, were the final proof corrected ten years
later, without losing in value.
</p>

<p>
The present form of these retrospective glances,
which skim lightly over half-a-dozen years in some kind
of chronological order, has been prepared from a manuscript
that has during the past two years received many
amendments; so that the reader has at least an unbiassed
account of a few years’ official residence in one
of the most promising of our Eastern possessions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vi' name='Page_vi' href='#Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The appalling multiplication of English books is
probably destined to continue until Macaulay’s New-Zealander
contemplates the ruins of St. Paul’s, and it
would almost appear that the classes and masses are
alike following Dr. Johnson’s advice: “Read anything
for five hours a day and you will soon be learned.”
</p>

<p>
In spite, however, of the modern facilities for publishing,
had there been no further object in view than the
narration of a few personal experiences, the author
would never have launched another venture on the
troubled sea. Our legislators have for some time past
been contemplating a distant and hazy vista of Utopia,
though faulty navigation has carried the vessel far
wide of the destination, and will, not improbably, land
her some day on the rocks.
</p>

<p>
Of particular and terrible interest is their future
Indian policy; and those who are good enough to
read the following pages will find not a few startling
instances of how far such policy has hitherto been based
on sound practical lines.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the author has maybe expressed his
convictions with candour rather than discretion; but as
he has ever stood by his guns, I think it would have
been exceeding what was expected of me, had I
modified one or two expressions of opinion that are
almost certain to meet with stormy weather in certain
latitudes.
</p>

<p>
So tiny and insignificant a craft, however, may surely
hope to ride the angry waves and arrive safely in
port.
</p>

<p class="post">
The conditions under which we now plough the ocean
or fly through continents present so remarkable a contrast
to the state of affairs half a century back, that we
who are in the autumn of life, with the signal of the
“sere and yellow leaf” fluttering feebly at the masthead,
can scarce realize the old coaching days, with their
thirteen hours’ travel to every hundred miles, as more
than an old dream.
</p>

<p>
Time in those days was, to all appearances, of less
commercial value than it is now, when it represents the
Golden Calf, and commerce is conducted by means of
electricity and steam. The merchant had to wait
patiently for months before learning the fate of his
argosies; Clive was eleven months reaching India; experience
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
and nautical skill reduced the time to six, and
improved routes to four months; while one month now
suffices, through the agency of steam, from Southampton
to Bombay. The arrival is then flashed home through
that “girdle” which Puck offered to put “round about
the earth in forty minutes.”
</p>

<p>
When the Victorian era takes its place in the pages
of England’s history, the revolution effected by electricity
and steam in its commerce, its battles, and its
treaties, will occupy a large and important part of the
interesting and glorious chapter.
</p>

<p>
Long voyages under canvas are nowadays therefore,
except as a means of recuperating one’s health, the
exception; and it is not surprising that the employment
of steam power should be so universal, whether from
considerations of time and business, or of sea-sickness
and pleasure; a steamer moves through fifteen or twenty
miles an hour day and night, independent of wind and
weather, whereas a sailing vessel is heavily handicapped,
having to quadruple the distance in constant “dogs’
legs,” besides being becalmed in certain latitudes for
days together.
</p>

<p>
The rising generation greet any allusion to the voyages
so common in the palmy days of the now defunct East
India Company with <i>fin-de-siècle</i> contempt; living, as
they do, in an atmosphere of perpetual excitement and
unrest, they are almost incapable of comprehending the
frame of mind in which their forefathers plodded through
their allotted span of life.
</p>

<p>
But as “many things by season season’d are to their
right praise and true perfection,” so the human mind
seems able to adapt and accommodate itself to the
varying circumstances of this transient sphere. A century
or so hence the people of this country will probably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
look on our modern naval and mercantile craft with as
critical an eye as that with which we contemplate the
<i>Victory</i>, or the first steamers of the P. and O. We pride
ourselves on the combination of size, speed, and comfort,
and the graceful lines of our floating palaces, on
their electric lighting and luxurious saloons; we feel
confident that not much more can be accomplished: yet
could we but “revisit the glimpses of the moon” in
1992, we should find ourselves in the midst of a new
creation.
</p>

<p>
On the 1st September, 185—, a majestic old frigate-built
East Indiaman lay moored off Spithead, all ready
to weigh anchor and awaiting only the arrival of the
pilot and one or two passengers, detained by accident
or otherwise. She was surrounded by numerous small
craft, some laden with various articles for sale, others
waiting to convey ashore those who had come aboard to
see the last of sons and daughters about to seek their
fortunes in the glorious East, where money was reputed
to be easily made, and men hungered for wives of the
European pattern.
</p>

<p>
Very mixed were the feelings of the passengers at the
moment of parting: regret on the one hand at being
separated from loving parents, severed from the tried
companions and indelible associations of early youth;
on the other, a certain feeling of independence and
freedom, and the natural ambition to get on in the world.
</p>

<p>
Many shook hands for the last time on this side of
the grave; and as the tiny craft pulled away and were
lost in the distance, the solitude of the cabin was sought,
and a blessing implored on the dear ones left behind.
</p>

<p>
There may be a reluctance on the part of many to
utter a prayer under normal conditions, but in an unusual
state of things there are, I believe, few who will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
not deviate from the beaten track and intuitively ask aid
from a higher power.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow, however, takes but a passing hold of the
elastic nature of youth; and when the shrill whistle of
the boatswain and the stamping of many feet on deck
proclaimed that the anchor was being weighed and the
canvas loosened, curiosity soon gained the ascendancy,
and, in spite of eyes still red with weeping, passengers
as yet unknown to each other might be seen occupying
every coign of vantage, and watching the sailors as they
sped round the capstan to some familiar air played on
the fiddle; and anon looking up as sail after sail was
loosened, then drawn home and bellied by the freshening
breeze. That she was moving soon became evident
from the noise made by the water and the gradual
diminution of familiar objects ashore. Glasses were
brought into requisition, and closed with a sigh when,
even with their aid, all was blurred, hazy, indistinct.
</p>

<p>
So faded that “white-faced shore, whose foot spurns
back the ocean’s roaring tide”; and before the end of
the year we were to look upon another of a very
different complexion, low, swampy, and muddy; fringed
with cocoanut trees, at the foot of which jackals shrieked,
making night hideous, and around which mosquitoes
buzzed and bit, as with the avowed mission of scaring
away nature’s sweet restorer.
</p>

<p>
To the officers and crew all the bustle of getting under
weigh was of course familiar; but to some fifty passengers,
starting for the most part on their first voyage, it
all seemed chaos: anon a stentorian voice gave an order,
resulting in a tramping of feet and the thud of ropes
falling on the deck, to the accompaniment of “Cheery,
boys, oh!” or some other ditty that was prime favourite
in those days.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Having made a fair offing, the good old ship bore
steadily down channel, the pilot entering his boat
somewhere off Start Point, and his “God speed!”
seemed to sever the last link that bound us to the mother
country.
</p>

<p>
Even in a comparatively calm sea the movement of
an East Indiaman was sufficient to test one’s sea-going
qualities, so that, when the bells had been struck for
meals, the cuddy table presented numerous gaps, while
certain ominous sounds proceeding from the direction of
the private accommodation announced to the happy few
the advent of that terrible ordeal <i>mal-de-mer</i>. Happily
for the majority of mortals it soon wears itself out; and
the stomach, conforming to the law that “use is second
nature,” soon becomes tolerant of the new order of
things, and ceases to resent the innovation of digesting
under conditions of perpetual motion. I only came
across one case in which sea-sickness became a source
of positive danger. The sufferer, a hale and healthy
man on coming aboard, was reduced in the course of a
couple of months to a mere bag of bones. What medical
aid failed to do was accomplished by nature; his
sickness ceased, and in lieu thereof he acquired an insatiable
appetite which distressed him. He apologized
for the amount that he ate at meals, and for filling his
pockets with biscuits afterwards; but he was powerless
to restrain himself, so that by the time we arrived at
our destination he was the counterpart of his original
self. I never saw him again, but I imagine that, if he
did ever return to Europe, his path lay through unexplored
regions, as I believe he would have attempted
to traverse them on foot rather than again enter a
cabin.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I never experienced sea-sickness; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
only influence that the motion of the ship had over me
was that I fell asleep on the least provocation, which
was very many times a day, as reading and writing were
equally out of the question.
</p>

<p>
By the time the dreaded Bay of Biscay had been
crossed, and the ship had entered warmer latitudes, the
deck presented a more animated appearance, and the
cuddy table became devoid of gaps. All sorts and conditions
of both sexes had now acquired their sea-legs,
and their sea-stomachs too; for the most part they ate,
I am convinced, more than was good for them. Sea-air
enjoys the reputation of stimulating the appetite,
and it undoubtedly had that effect in this particular
instance, assisted, maybe, by the seductive variety presented
at each meal. It was surprising, indeed, how
such a number could be so catered for day after day,
extending to the third part of a year: mutton, pork,
fowls, ducks, and geese were always forthcoming, to say
nothing of the ubiquitous ham; nor was there any falling
off in fresh bread and pastry, while the cows in the
long boat kept up the supply of milk. After each meal
the water astern became dotted with empty bottles—for
passengers, who could have as much ale, &amp;c., as they
pleased, <i>did</i> please—which, as they sank to great
depths, were probably shivered into fragments ere they
reached the bottom by the increasing pressure. Supposing,
indeed, the waters had dried up, the Cape route
to India could, I doubt not, have been easily traced by
these innumerable fragments of glass. The captious
critic, commenting on what we had done for that vast
continent extending from the Himalayas to Cape Cormorin,
was wont to remark that, had the Mutiny been
successful, empty bottles alone would have remained as
monuments of a century’s dominion. Thus we should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
have had the same memorial from Spithead to the
Hooghly, and might have figured as a nation in whose
administration glass figured as an important ingredient,
the captious one ignoring in all probability such insignificant
achievements as the Grand Trunk Road, and
suppression of Infanticide, Thuggee, and Suttee.
</p>

<p>
The only article on which any restriction was placed
was the fresh water allotted for the purpose of ablution,
more than a given quantity being obtainable only under
peculiar conditions. But temptation, like slander, “rides
on the posting winds, and doth belie all corners of the
earth,” and even old East-Indiaman stewards were
hardly above its subtle influence.
</p>

<p>
Unrestricted access, then, to everything save fresh
water, was the old order of things; and the P. and O.,
besides having kept abreast of the requirements of the
present day in the matter of shipbuilding, speed, and
comfort, deserve more credit than they actually got for
being the pioneers of so admirable an innovation as
lowering the passage-money, and charging extra for
wine, beer, and aërated waters.
</p>

<p>
Many of my contemporary travellers will remember
how from start to finish of a voyage the table was
crowded at breakfast, lunch, and dinner with bottles
containing various wines; in addition to which there
were frequent descents to the cuddy to slake an
imaginary thirst with a B. and S. This inordinate and
imaginary thirst died a natural death under the new
system of paying for what is ordered. A bottle of
claret on the breakfast table became the exception
rather than the rule: few made it “eight bells” to any
extent, and the pop of soda-water bottles became very
rare.
</p>

<p>
From the suspicious way in which we English approach
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
each other, whether in a private room or in a
public conveyance, it would seem as if there lurked in
our composition some of that cautious mistrust so
characteristic of the wild beast. But after having been
a week or so in each other’s company, the passengers
positively began to thaw towards one another; a welcome
change that was, however, succeeded by a still
harder frost. For a time, indeed, we constituted a
happy family, dancing, singing, and acting together;
but this temporary and unstable fusion of minds was
doomed to resolve itself into two antagonistic elements,
an untoward state of affairs that culminated only as the
good ship drew near her destination. There were two
ways of accounting for this division in the camp; my
own view of the matter was that we saw too much of
each other from “rosy morn till dewy eve,” which,
besides breeding contempt, gave birth to that “green-eyed
monster,” jealousy. But the sailors ascribed all
that went wrong to the presence of so many clergymen,
whom they looked upon as the <i>fons et origo</i> of storms
and everything undesirable. It is, however, a melancholy
yet undeniable fact that a number of human
beings herded together for any considerable length of
time will be sure to fall out, behaving in all probability
rather less charitably than so many tigers and jackals.
</p>

<p>
But on the whole, much as there was to lament in the
matter of ruffled tempers and petty ways, the outward-bound
vessel represented a perfect paradise during the
four months’ voyage, compared with the ordeal of a
similar period aboard a homeward-bound Indiaman.
To give even a faint idea of the angry conflagration of
passions by which the passengers in the latter were wont
to distinguish themselves, one would have to borrow
from the “Inferno” of Dante, and conjecture what must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
be going on in Pandemonium, where the evil spirits
meet in council!
</p>

<p>
The living freight was of the most volatile and
combustible nature, while the perpetual friction of its
conflicting elements—swarms of noisy children, and
touchy old men with disordered livers—kept the ship in
perpetual danger of destruction. But a merciful Providence
has tempered the wind to the Anglo-Indian by
pointing out an overland route, and consigning the
homeward-bound Indiaman, in so far as passengers are
concerned, to the pages of history; so that the danger
of spontaneous combustion is now confined to the cargo.
</p>

<p>
To resume our outward voyage. By the time we had
finished taking stock of each other, conjecturing why
So-and-so was going out to the East, the beautiful
island of Madeira hove in sight; but to our united
earnest entreaties to be allowed to land for a few hours
at Funchal the captain turned a deaf ear, expecting the
wind to change at any moment to a more favourable
quarter. For some time, however, it continued dead
against us, and the repeated tacking enabled us to obtain
different views of the peaceful isle, so near and yet so
far, with the land sloping up from the sea to some 6000
feet, and patches of cultivation appearing here and there
amid the thick woods.
</p>

<p>
With all the selfishness of youth, I fervently hoped to
remain weather-bound in such a paradise for an indefinite
period; but my hopes were literally blown away by the
wind itself, which “chopped” round, and Madeira faded
from view.
</p>

<p>
The beautiful is said to be a joy only as long as it
lasts; but my recollections of this island on which nature
has been so lavish have outlived so evanescent a period,
and I have often dreamt of it in later days. Had it only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
fallen in with the eternal fitness of things to have made
it a part of the outlying British Empire, English capital
and enterprise would have developed its resources,
seconding the efforts of Nature’s prodigality, instead of
counteracting them. We may possibly have already
acquired more than our share in all <i>five</i> quarters of the
globe without casting longing eyes on Naboth’s vineyard;
our possessions may reasonably excite the jealousy of
other powers, but no one can deny that we are specially
adapted, both physically and mentally, for colonization
far above any other nation; and that Madeira would
have shone with especial brilliancy in the British Crown
is a foregone conclusion.
</p>

<p>
On my first return voyage, years after, we landed at
St. Helena, which, interesting as it is from its historical
associations, cannot in my opinion compare with Madeira
in natural beauty.
</p>

<p>
Among the least pleasant experiences of the whole
voyage was the ordeal of being becalmed near the line,
where an oily sea sent back the glare of perpendicular
rays: several days of this sort of thing proved too much
for the tempers of the passengers, without evoking very
choice selections from the copious vocabulary of the
crew.
</p>

<p>
The cuddy table was patronized in stately silence, and
at any time, indeed, conversation became as spasmodic
and laconic as the merest courtesy would allow. We of
the civilized persuasion have somehow drifted into the
notion that it is imperative on us to talk at all times and
seasons, so that few tongues ever rest from morning to
night, when the timely interference of Providence
paralyzes for a time our power of speech.
</p>

<p>
Being becalmed in such a spot has its ludicrous as
well as its painful side; and few could help feeling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
amused at the sight of the ship’s bows pointing at
different times to every direction of the compass, as the
under-currents made us drift where we would not, intensifying
our utter helplessness.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, the captain would come on deck, look
around and aloft, whistle, and betake himself once more
to the sacred precincts of his cabin. The officer on
watch would imitate his chief with pious precision,
especially the whistle, in which he had the faith peculiar
to sailors in need of a favourable wind. But the son of
Astræas remained in obdurate seclusion in his Thracian
cave, and passengers and crew rose to the verge of
desperation.
</p>

<p>
One early hour out of the twenty-four contained,
indeed, some element of enjoyment, and that was when
the decks were undergoing the beneficial process of
“holy-stoning,” which consisted in rubbing them from
stem to stern with a species of pumice and a plentiful
supply of sea water. Then it was that the early bird
could get a most enjoyable bath, not in the sea, indeed,
which was infested with sharks, but on deck under the
full play of a hose.
</p>

<p>
The bath was customarily followed by a cup of tea,
extracted by bribery and corruption from the cook;
and then we generally paced the deck barefoot and
with just a suspicion of clothing, until the <i>levée</i> of El
Señor Sol, whom, from his nasty habit of insinuating
himself under the brim of one’s hat, I have always
found most trying at daybreak. The bath, the cup of
tea, and an anteprandial pipe were not the only advantages
of early rising, as one also escaped thereby the
extremely trying noise of “holy-stoning” directly over
one’s cabin.
</p>

<p>
No Hindoo, Mohammedan, or Buddhist ever went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
through his religious ceremonies with such unerring
regularity and unshaken faith as inspired the sailors in
their “holy-stoning,” in which process they seemed to
take especial delight, so that it almost amounted to
fetichism; and the face of the chief mate, who usually
presided at this daily celebration, would assume an
angelic expression that apparently stimulated the men
to further efforts.
</p>

<p>
Unquestionably great as are the benefits conferred by
the modern appliances and improvements in the art of
shipbuilding, in one respect at least the old Indiaman
had the whip-hand of its successor, and that was a
roomy cabin, a bed- and sitting-room combined, amply,
if not elegantly, furnished. Contrasted with the berth—or
“pigging”—system of modern ships, this was a
prodigious advantage, compensating to a great extent
for the length of the voyage. Being caged up with
several utter strangers, passing, for example, through
the Red Sea, and in a state of insufferable heat, is an
ordeal that one is not likely to forget; having to climb
at nights into an upper shelf, and, if one is fortunate
enough to sleep through the night without being
pitched out, putting one’s bare foot on the bald head
of the gentleman below, who also wanted to get up at
the same moment—these are instances of the luxury
of modern travel of which one hears so much. And we
bear it all with a patient shrug worthy of Shylock!
</p>

<p>
Another digression! But how can one help philosophizing
on board ship?
</p>

<p>
Whether from whistling or more natural causes, the
wind at last sprang up, and there was a visible accession
of spirits to the cuddy table—animal-spirits, I mean;
for the health of the breeze was drunk by one and all in
sparkling champagne.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Holy-stoning,” too, proceeded on the following
morning with unexampled vigour, and the chief mate’s
face positively beamed.
</p>

<p>
And now we crossed the line. The elaborate and
rather cruel ceremonies with which a previous generation
used to celebrate the “crossing” were by this time considerably
modified; though even now it was made an
opportunity for levying blackmail and inflicting personal
discomfiture on such as were in little favour with
the rest. We do not know for certain whether nectar
was intoxicating—though we should shrewdly suspect
such to be the case, considering the unaccountable
behaviour of some of the gods in Olympus—but it is
certain that Neptune, who shortly arrived on board,
was not superior to a mundane predilection for Jamaica
rum, an extra allowance of which was meted out to all;
so that he probably fell asleep in his chariot, leaving his
horses to find the way home by themselves.
</p>

<p>
Homeward-bound vessels were rarely visited by the
sea-god, from whose unwelcome attentions one was
exempted by having once crossed the line.
</p>

<p>
The next diversion on board was created by the
capture of a large shark that had been hovering in our
wake for several days, and suspected of having purloined
more than one joint of sailors’ pork, suspended from the
bowsprit to wash out superfluous salt. At last he was
caught in the act and duly reported; a deputation
waited on the chief mate, and, averse as captains are as
a rule to the mess that such a capture makes on the
“holy-stoned” deck, the dire decree went forth for his
punishment. This involved the sacrifice of yet another
leg of pork, and in a few moments he was on deck, his
spine being at once severed at its caudal extremity with
a blow from an axe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The shark, though in reality but little out of harmony
with the law of Nature, which is “one with rapine,” has
acquired with all nations, civilized and barbarian, a
reputation even worse than that enjoyed by its terrestrial
prototype—the tiger. It would be superfluous on my
part to describe the arrangement of his fins, or the size
and number of his serrated, lancet-shaped teeth; for do
they not nowadays teach Natural History even in
Board schools!
</p>

<p>
Still more remarkable than anything about the shark
itself is the presence of the two pilot-fish that almost
invariably flank its head on either side. These interesting
creatures instantly swim towards anything that is
thrown on the water, swim round it, and then return to
their patron; if it be a bottle, or any other inedible
object, all three then remain aloof, but if fit to eat, the
shark immediately makes for it.
</p>

<p>
When he is captured, indeed, they will swim for days on
either side of the rudder, with the fidelity of dogs; and
on one occasion I managed, after several hours’ hard
work, to entrap them both in a bucket. Belonging, as
they do, to the Scomberidæ, they bear in shape a pronounced
resemblance to the mackerel; the average
length is one foot, and the body, which is of a silvery
gray, is marked with five transverse dark bands; while
the dorsal fin, when erect, reminds one forcibly of the
perch, but the family to which they belong, and which
includes the albacore, bonito, and mackerel, has no
representative in fresh water.
</p>

<p>
Fried steaks cut from the tail-end of the defunct
shark were served that day at the Junior Officers’ Mess,
of which I was elected an honorary member; and I
must say that the dish was palatable in spite of the
associations that clung to the monster. The sailors of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
those days had a firm conviction that the appearance of
a shark forecasted a death on board. A lady occupying
a cabin next to mine was rapidly nearing her end from
the ravages of consumption, and I never looked out
upon the warm, still sea without perceiving a huge
shark swimming leisurely round the ship as it crept
slowly on. It was, of course, the merest coincidence,
and a word of encouragement from the captain would
have again placed shark-steaks on the <i>ménu</i>; I was so
impressed, however, with the hideous idea, that only
the presence of several invalids on board and the consequent
necessity for avoiding all unnecessary disturbance,
prevented me from putting a rifle-bullet into him as he
neared the surface.
</p>

<p>
At last the unfortunate lady succumbed, and the
shark immediately dived after the coffin, which was,
however, extra-heavily weighted at one end and pierced
with numerous holes; whether he accomplished his
nefarious purpose after the coffin rested amongst seaweeds,
strange crustaceans, and nautili, who shall say?
Anyhow, we saw no more of him.
</p>

<p>
Traversing the ocean in a modern steamer would
give one the idea that it is but scantily inhabited; the
churning of the screw is heard some way ahead, and all
the fish are scared away to the depths, so that an occasional
school of porpoises, too eager in the pursuit of
flying-fish, is about the only sight worth recording, and
then it only lasts a few moments, while the affrighted
creatures tumble headlong over one another in their
frantic endeavours to escape. Of a sailing vessel,
however, they take but little notice, gambolling
around in the most leisurely manner. They are
gregarious, not unlike the dolphin, but with a less
elongated snout, well armed with teeth adapted for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
seizing the small fish that form their staple article of
food.
</p>

<p>
Another fish partial to the wake of a sailing-ship, on
account of the amount of animal refuse which is thrown
overboard, is the bonito, closely allied to the tunny,
though smaller and more graceful. The average length
is between two and three feet, and it is, for its size, the
strongest fish I ever met with. Like the mackerel, its
congener, it is most beautiful directly after its removal
from the water; its back is steely-blue, which grows
lighter at the sides and eventually shades off into silver
under the belly, along which run several horizontal lines
of darker hue. The sailors harpoon it for sport rather
than for the sake of its flesh, which is coarse and somewhat
rank. When the ship is only creeping along with
but little wind, it is possible to take bonito on a spinning
bait; but very strong tackle is requisite for bringing it
on board. I have seen a successful (?) handliner, who
hooked a large bonito while fishing from a small boat,
towed in every direction for a considerably exciting
time before he could come to closer quarters with his
capture.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion I enjoyed some excellent mackerel-fishing
off St. Helena, catching enough to fill two ship’s
buckets in a very short time and with no other bait than
a few shreds of red rag. Suddenly the biting ceased,
and as the water was beautifully clear, one could plainly
discern the approach of a dim figure, large and powerfully
built—in fact, a bonito—which just sniffed at the
hooks and passed on majestically, after which the terrified
mackerel returned—to the buckets!
</p>

<p>
This novel sport was very enjoyable, lasting until I
was called away to conduct a party over the island and
make a few purchases. The scenery was certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
lovely, and the various spots connected with the brief
imprisonment of Napolean Buonaparte excited the
interest of the entire party; yet I must confess that I
should not care about it as a place of residence for any
length of time: it is not to be compared with Madeira
in any one particular.
</p>

<p>
The albacore, another of the Scomberidæ, is also frequently
caught or harpooned; it is a much thicker and
deeper fish than the last-named, sometimes attaining to
an enormous size. Its flesh, too, is in much higher
repute, and was equally appreciated by the nations of
antiquity who dwelt upon the shores of the Mediterranean,
in which sea it thrives along with its near relative
the tunny. The dorsal fin, which is situated rather far
back, graduates somewhat abruptly, vanishing into a
number of small finlets up to its unusually crescentic
tail with the same arrangement of finlets underneath.
</p>

<p>
Very interesting to the voyager are the performances
of those creatures called flying-fish, which probably
cause more amusement to passengers round the Cape
than any other members of the finny tribe.
</p>

<p>
The apparatus by which they are on special occasions
propelled for a short time through the air is nothing but
an unusual development of the pectoral fins; but it is at
least extremely doubtful whether they employ these
exactly as a bird uses its wings. I have many a time
observed them most carefully, but have always failed to
detect any flapping motion: the fins were merely extended,
and I noticed that in the direction of the wind they
could move through the air for some distance, when they
would fall back abruptly into their own element, as if
their muscular energy was suddenly expended; while
any attempt to proceed against the wind invariably
resulted in failure. I am, therefore, of opinion that as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
they emerge from the water with considerable “way”
on, the pectorals fully expanded, the wind drives them
as long as the latter keep moist; so that the whole proceeding
is a <i>vis a tergo</i> rather than a flight, though it is
doubtless extremely useful in escaping from their
greedy enemies, much as small fry will often take to the
air when pursued by a large jack.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, they only rise a short distance
from the water, though often sufficiently high to fall
upon the deck. Illustrations of the flying-fish generally
depict it as if about to mount up in the air and ascend
to the altitude patronized by larks, where, in company
with its fellows, it flits to and fro across the disc of the
sun like a swift. I like these illustrations; they show
a considerable power of imagination and not a little
impudence: unfortunately, however, the flying-fish is
not quite so amphibious. One variety—the <i>Exocœtus
volitans</i>—has now and again been found in British waters,
having presumably lost its way; or perhaps, after all,
the afore-mentioned illustrations are based on fact, and
the creatures have indeed flown overland from the
Mediterranean, where they abound along with the flying-gurnards
and similar species.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, in the warmer latitudes, the ship would
be surrounded by a fleet of argonauts, or paper-nautili,
which, if one excepts the fairer portion of the
passengers, are quite the prettiest creatures to be seen
during a voyage. The creature can easily quit the
shell, which resembles in shape that of the true nautilus,
not being attached to it as is the case with the majority
of molluscs. Beautiful as the creature unquestionably
is, yet it reminds one of the hideous octopus, in that
both are provided with a number of tentacles, two of
which, dilated to a circular membraneous expansion and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
raised above the water, bear a decided resemblance to
sails, while the others, which move under water, suggest
the action of oars. Hence arose the idea, which, still
prevalent at the time of which I am writing, has only
been combated comparatively recently, that they
actually sailed and rowed about.
</p>

<p>
The membranes, when unfurled, as it were, in the rays
of the sun, certainly display a variety of delicate colours,
that the famous “Judson” himself might envy but could
never imitate; but they are only seen to perfection on a
calm sea; the least disturbance sends them precipitately
into the inmost recesses of their shells, when they
instantly sink to the depths, presumably by some specially
devised apparatus, that enables them to exhaust the air,
since they cannot contract the volume of their habitat.
Perhaps the same arrangement permits of their generating
some kind of gas when they feel inclined to go to
the surface for a sail and a “look round.”
</p>

<p>
Sailors not infrequently confuse them with the so-called
“Portuguese man-o’-war,” which is, however, a
much lower and headless organization, living by suction,
and bearing but slight resemblance to the delicate and
many-coloured argonaut. This name will doubtless
recall to the reader’s mind that fabulous band of Greek
heroes who, under the leadership of Jason—not the
aforesaid Judson!—sailed forth to Colchis for the lofty
purpose of hoodwinking the sleepless dragon and stealing
the ram’s Golden Fleece.
</p>

<p>
At the time when the Exhibition of 1851 gave such
an impetus to Science and Art, the “argonaut,” “Portuguese
man-o’-war,” “Paper”-, and True-Nautilus were
very much confused in the minds of men generally, and
of sailors in particular. The shell of the last named was
sent from the East, and its nacred interior excited the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
admiration of all. In lieu of the discs common to the
cephalopods, it is provided with calcareous mandibles
with which it crushes the numerous small crustaceans,
on which it feeds as greedily as the octopus of the
Mediterranean and Southern Seas, or the “squid” that
plays such havoc in the Channel trawl-nets.
</p>

<p>
The only other sight worth recording was the occasional
blowing of a whale, that curious marine mammal,
whose incongruities have puzzled even eminent biologists.
There are many interesting questions in the life-history
of the whale of which we are in almost total ignorance;
such are, for example, its average age, which conjecture
has extended to centuries, and the period of gestation
before it launches its baby on the troubled waters—think
of it, a “baby” whale of some ten or twelve feet
in length! But what has always appeared to me the
most interesting point in the whale is the extraordinary
disproportion of its tiny throat—a throat not two inches
in diameter, so that an ordinary herring would choke the
largest whale. It behoves us, however, in all justice to
the most remarkable book that has ever appeared as the
universal delight of castle and cottage, to disregard the
emphasis with which its scientific detractors are wont to
decry some of its more remarkable assertions, and to
exculpate it, at least in this case—I refer, of course, to
the famous history of the rebellious prophet—where it
makes no mention of the exact species to which the
“great fish” belonged; the whale having been associated
with the story in later days by romancers whose intellect
is scarcely less remarkable than that of a somewhat
puerile clergyman, whom I once heard endeavour to
prove that the “great fish” was simply a common alligator,
which is about as abundant in the Mediterranean
as the whale itself!

</p>

<p>
In excessively warm latitudes, where certain winds
are contending for the mastery, waterspouts are not
uncommon, and are, of course, dreaded in proportion to
their proximity to the ship. They are analogous to the
whirlwind on land, the ascending column in the latter
being charged with particles of dust, instead of, as at
sea, with condensing vapour.
</p>

<p>
In either case, distance lends enchantment!
</p>

<p class="p2">
Such, then, were a few of the sights and speculations
afforded, in the days when journeys were calculated by
months, by the great world without, as a means of
beguiling the time when wind and weather permitted
one to stay on deck.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely less remarkable were the diversions of the
little world within; the shifts to which we were put in
our unflagging endeavours to relieve the monotony of
“life below stairs;” but I must leave these to another
chapter, in which I hope to reach the end of my voyage.

CHAPTER II.
<br />
STILL UNDER CANVAS.

<p class="o1">“O’er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,</p>

Some portion of the time, however, was necessarily
spent below. Dancing was the favourite pursuit with
the majority, but was only practicable when the wind
was light and the sea calm.
</p>

<p>
Although Terpsichore was my least beloved of the
Nine, one had but little choice when the promenade
deck was cleared, and the pale light of the moon
supplemented by all the lanterns that could be spared.
</p>

<p>
Music, too, furnished a deal of enjoyment, both to
those who could perform themselves and to the
majority who could only appreciate the performances
of others.
</p>

<p>
A large stern cabin, almost the only one unoccupied
by passengers, was turned into a saloon, where singing
could be indulged in without fear of disturbing others.
The custodian of this sanctum was the captain’s wife,
herself a well-trained musician; and she only issued
invitations on the strict stipulation that there was to be
no flirting. And I think, indeed, that the few flirtations
were strictly of the Platonic order; and that most of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
the young ladies were led to the Hymeneal alter within
a few weeks of their landing, not—be it observed—by
any of their shipmates, but by older residents in the
country; some may have succumbed in the “City of
Palaces,” but the majority were probably in request
farther up country.
</p>

<p>
Yes, India was a famous place for matrimony in those
days. The supply almost equalled the demand: the
arrival of an Indiaman sent a thrill of excitement
through many a manly breast; and much manœuvring
was resorted to in order to see the young ladies land.
</p>

<p>
But the whirligig of time and the agency of steam
have considerably modified the Furlough Rules; and
men come to England to marry the women, instead of
the women going to India to marry the men.
</p>

<p>
Without meaning to be hypercritical, one is tempted
to wish that Indiamen were freighted as of yore!
</p>

<p>
The efforts of those who most did congregate in the
music-room soon led to a concert, which was an undeniable
success. The great feature of the evening was an
Ethiopian entertainment, preceded by a prologue given
by Bones and Banjo, part of which still lives in my
memory, especially a borrowed epigram, levelled at a
certain individual who laboured under the delusion that
he was no mean vocalist:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Swans sing before they die: ’twere no bad thing</p>
<p>Should certain persons die before they sing.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
A higher flight in the intellectual domain was now
attempted in the shape of a weekly paper, over which a
man of erudition, one at least who had successfully
climbed the rungs of a University career, was soon persuaded
to preside, while his wife undertook to provide a
manugraph.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Contributions, signed only with a <i>nom-de-guerre</i>, had
to be placed in a box affixed to the mainmast, of which
the editor had the key; and, from the conspicuous
absences, it soon became evident that many were deep
in the agonies of composition.
</p>

<p>
But even this flower of promise was nipped in the
bud; and the captain showed his experience of the
ways of passengers when he prognosticated that it
would share the fate of any other nine days’ wonder.
</p>

<p>
Before its extinction, however, this unhappy organ
fanned into a flame the smouldering embers of cliqueism,
which had originated with dancing.
</p>

<p>
Except during the prevalence of the trade-winds, our
“runs” varied very considerably. These particular
winds, however, brought contentment to all; they are
uniformly cool and steady by day and night; every
stitch of canvas is set, and the ship heels over to a
certain angle and there remains for days together, so
steady, indeed, that on a specially inclined table one
could with comfort indulge in billiards.
</p>

<p>
The officers and crew have a comparatively easy time
of it as long as these winds last, being exempt from all
necessity of furling, reefing, or bracing of yards—while
the enjoyment extends even to the dumb portion of the
“live stock,” the cows in the long-boat, the sheep in
their pens, and the poultry—everywhere.
</p>

<p>
To the uninitiated it appeared strange that we should,
when outward bound, have to proceed so far south in
order to round the Cape, while on the homeward journey
we could hug it so closely as to see the low-lying coast;
but the phenomenon was easily to be accounted for by
the prevalence of certain winds and oceanic currents.
</p>

<p>
The history of the art of navigation, from the mariner’s
compass of the fifteenth century, when Columbus discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
its variations, down to the perfect instruments
of the present day, has always seemed to me highly
interesting. Even in the sailing days the captains
practised it with wonderful accuracy. Far out in mid-ocean,
we were bearing right on an island laid down in
the chart, and I asked the captain whether he intended
altering the ship’s course. “Not at all,” he replied;
“we shall sail right over it.” We did so. An early
navigator probably saw a dead whale there, which he
duly entered on the chart. And unquestionably as
logarithms and modern instruments have simplified
matters, it is even now not quite so easy as it appears.
</p>

<p>
We had now entered colder latitudes, where we were
glad to put away the easy-chairs and fold up the awning,
and in lieu thereof pace the decks in a vigorous manner
enveloped in warm clothing. But we were not unprepared
for the change, which came on gradually; and,
even in its extremes, did not approach that which was
once experienced by a Bishop of Newfoundland, who
had to visit a small island in his diocese that lay right
in the Gulf Stream. He left his main charge, so he told
me, enveloped in furs, but the moment his steam yacht
crossed the line of demarcation—perceptible by the
change of colour in the water—he had to exchange them
for the thinnest garments he could muster. The exact
readings of the thermometer plunged in on either side
the line, as he told them to me, I no longer remember;
but I do recollect being struck by the great difference—so
great, indeed, that, had the information not come
from such a source, I should have been incredulous.
Great as are the irregularities in the weather that one
experiences during a sea voyage, they vanish when
compared with the caprices of the true British climate.
And yet we take a kind of gloomy national pride in it;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
and I have known homeward-bound Englishmen quite
looking forward to a “Channel fog” from the moment
they left Bombay. A juster appreciation of its merits
is shown by our Yankee cousins, one of whom said of
our atmosphere: “No climate, not even weather;
nothing but samples”; while another is responsible for
the following excellent parody of a well-known rhyme:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Dirty days hath September, April, June, and November;</p>
<p>From January to May, the rain it raineth every day;</p>
<p>From May until July, there’s not a dry cloud in the sky;</p>
<p>All the rest have thirty-one, without a blessed ray of sun;</p>
<p>And if their days were two and thirty, they’d be just as wet and<br />quite as dirty.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The evenings were now long, and our share of daylight
was curtailed, so that a still greater proportion of
our time was spent below in conversation, cards,
chess, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Our habits with regard to “turning-in” were somewhat
primitive; all lights had to be out by 10 p.m., and
a responsible officer went the rounds to see that the
dictum was scrupulously carried out.
</p>

<p>
The very thought of “fire” on a wooden ship well
saturated with tar, and far away in mid-ocean, was
enough to make one’s blood run cold; and so it is not
to be wondered at that the captain showed his teeth on
one occasion, when one of the passengers was reported
for infringing this law, and threatened to place him in
irons for the rest of the voyage. Need I say that the
offender gave no further cause for complaint?
</p>

<p>
We may be thankful that nowadays the chances of a
fire breaking out on board ship are, thanks to the electric
light and the less combustible materials of which our
ships are built, reduced to a minimum.
</p>

<p>
The ladies were invariably the first to retire, though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
they probably continued prattling until long after we
were in bed and asleep; a habit which, as Dundreary
said, “No fellow could understand.” Precept and example
have been tried in vain: for as it was in the
beginning, &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
After we had been at sea for some time without seeing
a living thing other than fish, the air suddenly became
alive with Cape pigeons and albatrosses; and I managed
to capture one of the latter on a stout hook baited with
a piece of pork. After a little hesitation, he pounced
upon the prize, and, raising his beak, swallowed it at a
gulp.
</p>

<p>
I was fully prepared for his taking flight, and, indeed,
had he got my line foul of the rigging, I should soon
have been in difficulties. But, discarding such a course,
he planted his webbed feet firmly before him, offering
thereby such resistance to the water that it was no easy
matter to get him alongside. At last, after I had received
timely assistance from a passing sailor, the bird
stood on deck, and was at once violently sick, vomiting
great quantities of a clear, oily liquid. I have since
learnt that all sea-birds are sick on board ship, and quite
unable to use their wings.
</p>

<p>
According to my invariable practice of despatching
my victims as quickly as possible, I killed this one immediately—one
might almost add painlessly—with a
small dose of prussic acid. He turned out to be a very
plump bird, measuring fifteen feet from tip to tip of his
outspread wings. By an unfortunate misunderstanding
on the part of one of the sailors, my capture was thrown
overboard before I had set up the skeleton; the only
use that was made of it being the employment of a few
of the feathers to show the direction of the wind, or, as
one of our passengers with a poetical turn of mind put it:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Oh! bid them beware of ships that go from London to the Indies,</p>
<p>Else they’ll be caught, and their feathers plucked to show which way the wind is.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
By far the most graceful of the many other species of
sea-birds that were continually hovering about the ship
were the stormy petrel, or, as the superstitious sailors
call them, “Mother Carey’s Chickens.” Their wonderfully
rapid flight, now in the hollow between two waves,
anon on the foaming crest of another, really looks more
like walking on the water; and I understand that petrel
is only a corruption of Peter. Among the sailors they
have a bad reputation, and are regarded as birds of ill
omen, a superstition which, on the principle of “give a
dog a bad name,” &amp;c., has clung to them, but which is
in reality quite undeserved. Ignorance and tradition
have, in fact, placed the cart before the horse: the
stormy petrel follows storms, but cannot possibly foretell
them.
</p>

<p>
By a modification of my albatross line, I managed to
capture several of them; a proceeding, however, which
had to be conducted with great secrecy; as, had the
sailors got wind of it, and a storm followed by coincidence,
I should probably have figured as the hero in a
repetition of Jonah’s history—minus the “great fish”;
and I am by no means sure whether even that important
detail would have been wanting.
</p>

<p>
About this time we fell in with an emigrant ship;
signals were exchanged under Marriott’s Code, and it
was intimated that the presence of our captain was
wanted on board. Both ships accordingly hove to; and
in a weak moment of impulse I sought permission to
occupy a place in the captain’s gig. The request was
readily acceded to, and, if confession be at all desirable, I
am quite prepared to confess to a slight degree of nervousness,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
as the small craft rose and fell in the most frolicsome
manner, as if indeed she were glad to feel herself
once more in the water. All sorts of horrible fancies
coursed through my mind: what if the wind suddenly
shifted, causing those flapping sails to belly out and
carry both the ships farther away! We were hundreds
of miles from land, and we had not so much as a biscuit
or a drop of fresh water in the gig. Then I reviewed
mentally all the terrible stages—casting lots, glaring at
each other, &amp;c., &amp;c., and—we were alongside. The
captain disappeared below, but I of course stayed on
deck talking to the emigrants. How brave and sanguine
they were; how little they seemed to heed the dreary
prospect of a far-off country full of privations, where all
would be up-hill work for many a long year. They saw
Hope pointing to the bright to-morrow, to fields ripe
with golden corn, the fruit of their labour, and homesteads
made glad with the merry laughter of children.
I wonder how many realized the vision! They crowded
on deck, and their “Cheer, boys, cheer,” gradually waxed
fainter and fainter as we neared our own ship.
</p>

<p>
When standing once more amongst my fellow-passengers,
who plied me with all manner of questions, my
thoughts reverted to those brave emigrants, and I dwelt
with almost selfish complacency on the great difference
between their prospects and our own.
</p>

<p>
Most of us were going out in the employ of a Company
that reputedly paid its servants handsomely, and
treated them kindly; we were to be enrolled as units in
an administration never equalled in the world’s history:
where all grades performed their duty <i>con amore</i>, and
where officers were happy and contented, knit together
by ties of brotherhood.
</p>

<p>
I will not sigh for the old order of things: it would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
be unseemly in one who has served under the new; but
one cannot help remarking that it was the Mutiny which
swept away the old peaceful era, substituting one of an
opposite nature both in the European and the native
elements. The Company gauged and respected the
prejudices of the community over which it ruled; and,
if it was not exactly loved, it was at least respected.
</p>

<p>
Now, however, Western ideas and Western methods
of thought have, in spite of protest, been forced upon
the aborigines. Up to the end of 1858-9 their respect
for us was as sincere as could be expected from the
people of a conquered country; but since that time the
gulf has gradually widened, till, if another Mutiny were
to break out, the whole of the population would be
against us, instead of, as on the former occasion, for us.
Under the cloak of giving them a <i>quid pro quo</i> for all
the incalculable benefits which they have, however involuntarily,
bestowed upon us, we continually force ourselves
into places which they hold most sacred, and add
insult to injury by endeavouring to propitiate them with
dolls and other refuse of our fancy bazaars!
</p>

<p>
As to the Mutiny, the exciting cause was undoubtedly
the manner in which home influence and interference
undermined the discipline of the army: the annexation
of Oude and the episode of the greased cartridges
were but handles to lay hold of. But of this more
anon.
</p>

<p>
One evening a circumstance occurred which for the
moment aroused the monster envy, that had, for a time
at least, slumbered peacefully, and overthrew all our
confidence in our captain and our pride in our vessel.
A bright light was reported astern, which rapidly
loomed larger and larger, bearing down upon us with
most astounding speed. Some thought it must be a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
pirate, and propounded ingenious and reassuring questions
as to the latest fashion in “walking the plank.”
</p>

<p>
Presently, two more lights were reported just above
the horizon, which gained upon us equally rapidly, and
then it dawned upon the mind of one of the passengers
that the Cape route was to be essayed with a large
steamer, of which the first was the pioneer.
</p>

<p>
She came, she saw, she conquered; and we, who had
hitherto regarded our ship as a veritable hare, now discovered,
to our intense chagrin, that she was but a
tortoise after all.
</p>

<p>
Added to this discomfiture, we had to listen to
such banter as: “Can we do anything for you in
Calcutta, besides telling them that you’re coming some
day?”
</p>

<p>
Her lights soon vanished far ahead! Was it a
phantom vessel, the creature of a distempered brain?
</p>

<p>
For some time we maintained a significant silence
round the cuddy; after which, thanks to the genial
influence of the <i>old</i> system of provisioning, tongues were
loosened and opinions freely expressed.
</p>

<p>
For my own part, I was in no hurry for the voyage to
draw to a close; not only did the dangers of being at
sea appear to me no greater than those with which we
are beset on land, but I looked upon it as a respite from
the pestilence that was ever strutting about the land for
which we were bound.
</p>

<p>
What if the steamer did arrive many days before us;
would it make any practical difference in the life ahead?
Others, I regret to say, thought differently; they fretted
and fumed, vilified sailing vessels in general, ours in
particular, and made themselves generally miserable,
frowning whenever their eye fell on the unoffending
sails, and sneering at the “run,” which, seeing that it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
kept a steady ten or twelve miles an hour, was hardly
to be grumbled at.
</p>

<p>
Man is a strange creature, and he exhibits himself
under a variety of phases; but nowhere, perhaps, so
remarkably as during a long sea-voyage.
</p>

<p>
We had now reached our southernmost point, and
were steering in a north-easterly course.
</p>

<p>
The only break in the monotony of this part of the
voyage was made by our passing the extremities of
these deserted volcanic islets, St. Paul’s and Amsterdam,
of which I attempted a sketch, which occasioned no
little amusement.
</p>

<p>
These dreary oases of fused rock are said to contain
two springs in juxtaposition, one of boiling and the
other of cold water. These might, as I reflected, afford
invaluable assistance to a shipwrecked mariner, who
could possibly boil a fish or a stray gull’s egg in the
former, while the latter would supply the means of performing
his ablutions and quenching his thirst. The
only geographical interest attaching to these spots is
that they are equidistant from the Cape of Good Hope,
Ceylon, and Tasmania.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the ship was rapidly approaching her destination;
the days of the voyage were already numbered,
and it was resolved to give a grand fancy dress ball
on the first evening that we should spend at anchor in
the river. From the difference in the colour of the
water, it soon became apparent that the remainder of
the voyage might be counted by hours; the Gangetic
delta was pouring forth its mud from many gaping
mouths; and the water grew more and more uninviting,
till we at last passed the Pilot Brig, and anon came in
sight of a low-lying, muddy-looking coast, fringed with
cocoanut trees. In an hour or so we were in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
Hooghly; and I cannot say that either the river or its
banks impressed me very favourably.
</p>

<p>
We were now in the month of December, which, being
the coolest season of the year, is the favourite time of
arrival for all sorts and conditions of ships; and it was
probably in consequence of this that no steam tug was
at first available to tow us the remaining hundred
miles. Very reluctantly, therefore, we had to let go the
anchor only a short distance from the mouth of the
river.
</p>

<p>
That night we were to have enjoyed the fancy dress
ball for which so much preparation had been made,
when an untoward accident put an end to all our merriment.
A young middy, a promising lad and a great
favourite on board, fell from the mizen-top—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“To die! to sleep:</p>
<p>To sleep! perchance to dream.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Such is fate! William III, whose diseased and
emaciated form had survived the thickest of a dozen
frays, dies through his horse stumbling on a mole-hill in
his own park; a great African explorer is killed by the
accidental explosion of his own gun; so, too, our poor
little middy, after having many a time helped furl a sail
in mid-ocean, with the billows raging in their fury, and
the lightning playing about the yards, must needs fall
here, with the vessel riding at anchor in a very duck-pond!
He was probably a victim to sunstroke. Never
shall I forget the thud that brought me up from below,
caused by his head being shattered against the deck.
One of the ship’s boats conveyed his remains to a small
European cemetery not far from the shore, where others
of his countrymen had preceded him—a lonely spot,
around which the jackal yelled and the tiger prowled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As the tug could not be with us till the following day,
I seized the opportunity of going ashore in one of the
native craft with which European ships are invariably
beset on entering an Eastern river.
</p>

<p>
I proceeded on foot through a small village, very clean
and regularly built, composed of well-thatched, one-storied
houses. Something—I suppose it was the
manner in which the men were lolling about and
smoking, while the women did all the work—reminded
me of small villages that I had seen in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
But what first attracted my attention was the ubiquitous
sparrow, just as impudent and pugnacious-looking as
ever. I now came to a tract of dried-up rice-fields, as
hard as brick-bats, where the trees were few and far
between, and were for the most part alive with parroquets
of gorgeous plumage, chattering and jabbering, as
if, forsooth, they had to settle the affairs of the whole
country. I therefore varied the monotony of the walk
by shooting an occasional bird, which, however, proved
quite useless for culinary purposes. As it grew late in
the day, I turned back towards the shore; and it appeared
to me a favourable opportunity for returning the
kindness of the junior officers, at whose hospitable mess
I had discussed many a leathery piece of salt pork and
weevil-eaten biscuit, washed down with rum and water.
By means of a great deal of gesticulating—for I knew
not a word of the language—I became the proud possessor
of a goodly store of live fowls, eggs, and
plantains, for what I afterwards discovered to be about
three times the correct price. I was received with
thanks on board, and, from my doubtless grotesque
appearance, armed with a gun and umbrella, and surrounded
by my provisions, was forthwith dubbed
“Robinson Crusoe.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
</p>

<p>
While anchored in the lower reaches of the river, we
experienced a slight foretaste of some of the pleasures
that awaited us in the land we were about to reside in;
our night’s rest was ever and anon disturbed by the
weird and startling cry of a jackal; and the dermic
irritation caused by mosquito-bites was a source of great
pain to novices.
</p>

<p>
At last the tug arrived, and we once more got under
weigh, rapidly bridging over the remaining part of the
voyage, and perhaps, too, the most dangerous, on
account of the St. James and Mary shoals, and many
others almost equally hazardous. But these were passed
in safety; the river became narrower and narrower—crowded,
too, with all manner of small craft freighted
<i>en route</i> to market. The whole scene was certainly
striking, rendered, indeed, still more picturesque by the
setting sun; so that, as we passed up that suburb of
Calcutta so appropriately called “Garden Reach,” the
entire bank was bathed in a flood of light, while our ears
were assailed by the chants of natives pulling at their
oars—chants not devoid of a weird kind of beauty. Not
far above this we dropped anchor, and the ship swung
round with the tide. All was bustle and excitement;
and with a shake of the hand, and a hurried “Good-bye;
mind you call on us soon,” &amp;c., &amp;c., the passengers
dropped one by one over the side; and in this wise the
voyage of those days came to an end.

<br />
THE CITY OF PALACES.

<p class="post">
For my own part I remained on board till the deck
had assumed a less chaotic appearance, when I resolved
to migrate temporarily to one of the hotels. This, however
was not to be; for an old friend, anticipating my
resolve, and bent on frustrating it, suddenly appeared on
board with the welcome information that he had hired
a room for me at his quarters. Nothing loth, I bundled
my traps into the boat, and prepared to accompany my
friend, bidding <i>au revoir</i> to the officers with no little
regret; they had throughout the voyage treated me
with the utmost courtesy, and I had almost grown to
look upon the old ship as my home. Nor was the City
of Palaces just then calculated to impress a new
arrival very favourably, or to raise his spirit-barometer.
Darkness was coming on apace, as it always does in the
East, and the dim, weird light afforded by the few oil
lamps scattered about was considerably obscured by the
dense mist that was rising from a large open space,
through which we drove in my friend’s “buggy.” This
sombre picture was completed by the dusky figures that
flitted hither and thither; and, taken altogether, I found
it gruesome and depressing.
</p>

<p>
The house in which my friend resided was a boarding-establishment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
(with <i>table d’hôte</i>), very convenient for
temporary sojourners of the male persuasion; we sat up
till a very late, or rather, early hour, as there was much
to chat about; and eventually my friend consigned me
to the care of his own special valet, with the most
detailed instructions—for I knew not a word of the
language—and wished me “Good night.” With
sundry misgivings, I followed my swarthy attendant,
who glided noiselessly in front of me. The room that
had been assigned to my use was evidently very
spacious—one can tell somehow when one is in a large
room, even in total darkness—but as it was only very
dimly illuminated by a small wick steeped in oil, I was
unable to ascertain its exact dimensions until the next
morning. I remember that it also struck me as chilly
and damp, and I wished myself back in the cosy cabin
in which I had enjoyed many an uninterrupted night’s
rest for the last four months. In the middle of the
apartment I discerned a bed, surmounted by an enclosure
of netting; on one side was a strip of carpet,
and close at hand stood a chair. Now, my friend had
particularly impressed on me that the mosquitoes were
just now very strong on the wing, and as hungry as
hunters; also that on the manner in which I got under
the netting depended all my chances of sleep. He further
instructed me to sign to the “bearer” when I was ready,
who would, he said, just raise the edge of the curtain,
when I must jump in. The eventful moment arrived: I
signed to the “bearer,” and pointed to the bed, whereupon
he commenced beating the air around with a
kind of switch, and lifted a corner of the net.
</p>

<p>
By this time I began to realize in the whole proceeding
a pleasurable element of excitement, and as he
raised the net, I darted in. Alas! it was but to fall out
the other side. I felt myself going, and as a drowning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
man will clutch at a straw, I held on to the bedclothes,
dragging them along with me, curtains and all. When
I had at length got clear, there was the “bearer” staring
at me as if I were a wild beast or a lunatic; then
he fled—returning shortly afterwards with another set
of curtains, after which he once more made the bed.
This <i>entrée</i> was successfully accomplished; but my
troubles did not end here. The fact was, I felt uncommonly
cold; suddenly a happy thought occurred to me,
and stealthily thrusting out an arm from under the
curtains, I dragged in my clothes and the strip of carpet.
I slept soundly, but woke betimes—as who, indeed, even
of the Seven Sleepers, would not have?—for of all the
discordant uproars I had ever heard, the <i>réveille</i> of the
feathered tribe—crows, minahs, and other villains—certainly
stood first.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards the “bearer” entered, noiseless as
a tiger, and proceeded to open the shutters and admit
the morning light. He next advanced to my couch
with the evident intention of rousing me, but seeing the
additions that I had made in my bed-clothing, stopped
short. I pretended to be asleep, but watched him carefully.
The poor fellow opened his eyes to their widest,
looked round the room, thought for a moment, and
then fled as before; returning this time in the company
of my friend, who glanced at the bed, and immediately
roared with laughter. It was all very funny, no doubt;
but, not being quite able to appreciate the joke, I took
refuge in pretended sleep. Later on, at breakfast, I
gave a detailed account of what had happened, which
my friend supplemented with the “bearer’s” version.
Poor bearer! In spite of repeated explanations, he
avoided me as much as possible, and evidently considered
me dangerous. A day or two after I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
claimed by a relation, and that domestic at least was
greatly relieved by my departure! There is, gentle
reader, a right and a wrong way of getting <span class="smcap">into</span> bed as
well as <span class="smcap">out of</span> it, as I found to my cost on more than
one occasion; as, for example, the first stormy night at
sea, when I made use of my swing-cot.
</p>

<p>
Ignorance both of the language of the country and of
the vast vocabulary of Anglo-Indian expressions was a
sad drawback to anything like real enjoyment in those
early days; as, besides feeling a bore of the first-water,
having to ask so many questions, one felt more or less
at every one’s mercy.
</p>

<p>
At my first dinner-party I well recollect a gentleman
inviting me to take “simkin” with him; politeness constrained
me to accept “with pleasure”—and also with
some secret misgivings; and some coagulated stuff was
shot into my glass, which, on melting, turned out to be
champagne—a word beyond any native’s power of pronunciation,
and, in consequence, corrupted into “simkin”
by natives and Europeans alike.
</p>

<p>
Another friend begged me to call on him at some
house in “Mango Lane.” I promised to do so, but, unfortunately
suspecting a practical joke, I retaliated by
telling him that my abode was “Pine-Apple Alley.”
Had I only inquired, matters would have turned out
otherwise. As it was, the poor fellow drove all over the
town in search of a place that did not exist; while I
never took the slightest trouble to find out his abode,
though it was situated in one of the most important
thoroughfares in Calcutta, where merchants most did
congregate. Shortly afterwards we met out driving;
and after the ensuing explanation, I made the <i>amende
honorable</i>.
</p>

<p>
I have already said that Calcutta did not impress me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
favourably at first; and after each subsequent visit I
disliked the place more and more.
</p>

<p>
The event of the day, to which all looked forward
with great eagerness, was the evening drive up and down
a road running parallel with the river; but its duration
was of the briefest. As if by magic, the place would
suddenly swarm with all sorts of conveyances, from the
well-appointed barouche to the modest buggy. The
ladies, one and all, looked cadaverous, so much so that I
felt quite concerned about them; but was somewhat
reassured by my friend’s reply to my inquiries: “Oh!
no, they are all ill; they all get like that after they have
been out here a short time.”
</p>

<p>
As far as I could judge, the aim of each native coachman
was to outdrive his fellow Jehu, for we certainly
moved at a break-neck pace. Consequently, I seldom
saw any of my shipmates there. That rapid transit for
a brief hour in an open conveyance, with occasionally
an hour’s visiting and shopping in a closed one, seemed
to me all the outdoor exercise that the ladies had, and
this accounted in a great measure for the extreme pallor
of their complexions.
</p>

<p>
In the way of contrasts, I do not think I ever beheld
anything so pronounced as the fresh, rosy, and yet
bronzed complexions of the new arrivals, and those of the
more acclimatized specimens of the gentler sex; yet at
the same time, where there prevailed any redundancy of
colour and tendency to coarseness, the climate appeared
to exercise an ameliorating effect, imparting grace and
refinement.
</p>

<p>
I thought, of course, that every one would be abroad
in the early morning, but the Europeans were conspicuous
by their absence; and, during the colder months at least,
the state of the atmosphere was none too inviting, as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
chilly mist invariably hung over the place like a pall, to
be dispersed only when the sun was too high to render
going forth at all agreeable.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding, I used to make my way through it
from one end of the large, open space—the “Maidan”—to
the other, returning home with my hair and moustache
covered with dewy moisture.
</p>

<p>
I used on these occasions to meet with one countryman,
who, like myself, felt bound to have his morning
“constitutional” at any price; and after various stages
of recognition we became closely acquainted. I came
across him a year ago—nearly forty years after the
time of which I write—in Richmond; we were both
<i>walking</i>!
</p>

<p>
During the day, with the sun shining upon it, the
City of Palaces looked somewhat imposing, especially
the business quarters, alive with people of almost every
nationality, and the most heterogeneous collection of
conveyances, foremost among which was the indigenous
“Palkee.” It was pleasant to watch—from a distance;
in fact, the perfumes of Arabia did not predominate;
and, as water-carts were an unknown quantity, the dust
and the glare combined to produce headache and thirst,
the latter being temporarily quenched by various
American drinks, in which, as my head told me, rum
predominated.
</p>

<p>
There was an amazing demand for these drinks; and,
without wishing to enlarge on their merits or the reverse,
I must say they were honest drinks, compounded of the
best materials, and very unlike those that I have tasted
under similar names at certain of our Exhibitions.
</p>

<p>
The most appalling thing about the Calcutta of those
days was the nauseating effluvium that arose from all
parts of it; this was a smell <i>sui generis</i>, noticeable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
indeed in and around “Chowringhee,” the European
quarter; still more so in the neighbourhood of the best
shops; and reaching its climax in the China Bazaar, a
den of the most arrant thieves to be met with in any
country. I imagine that it was a peculiar distillation of
sewage, brought about by the action of a hot sun; and
I remarked its peculiar intensity at daybreak, and just
after nightfall. On one occasion, I mistook the hour
for a funeral, and arrived a great deal too soon at the
rendezvous, which was close to that exceedingly filthy
river the Hooghly; I was, I remember, well-nigh poisoned—a
dissecting-room could hardly come up to it.
I had almost said that, on the part of the residents,
familiarity with the odour had bred contempt; but that
would be falling short of the mark, inasmuch as I believe
they had positively learned to like it.
</p>

<p>
The mention of smells associated with sewers brings
to my mind the “bandicoot” rat, one of which, to my
considerable discomfiture, I saw making its way across
my friend’s “compound.” It appeared to me quite as
large as a leveret, and considerably more formidable,
nor was I greatly reassured by the information, “Oh!
that’s <i>only</i> a bandicoot; plenty of them about.” The
term “bandicoot” is a corruption of the native name
<i>pandikoku</i>, which signifies pig-rat. It is a clean feeder
living on grain and roots, and is said to be as delicate
eating as the porcupine. The internecine “war of the
rats,” waged in our country between the black and the
brown, terminated in favour of the former, those useful
scavengers that, for the most part, live in our sewers;
but in the East—from which they were, like most other
nasty things, originally imported—they swarm everywhere,
and are most destructive. For the sake of the
grain, which my sheep would turn out of their troughs,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
each in his eagerness to obtain the lion’s share, they
positively honeycombed my field. Having in vain tried
extermination by means of drowning and smoking, I
bethought me as a last resource of phosphorescent paste,
and by spreading it on pieces of native bread and
placing it near their holes, I killed heaps of them, which
were buried under my vine with good effect.
</p>

<p>
I thoughtlessly tried the same experiment in my
bungalow; this time, however, instead of coming out to
die as they had done in the field, the rats preferred to
die in retirement. I consequently had to vacate the
house for six weeks, during which time it was thoroughly
dismantled and purified. They not unfrequently show
fight. On one occasion, going to a cupboard late at
night, in search of some supper for a friend and myself,
I found everything in the possession of rats. We drove
them off for a time, but they returned to the charge, and
even came on the table in numbers, literally fighting
with us for the mastery. Carving-knives, however,
gained the victory, but not until a dozen or so had
been disposed of. Fortunately the bandicoot is not
aggressive, otherwise not knives but swords would be
necessary.
</p>

<p>
During the first few weeks at Calcutta I had occasion
to make a few purchases in the way of light clothing,
and boldly dived into that unsavoury locality the China
Bazaar. The dealers recognized the novice by their own
inherent instinct, and set to work accordingly.
</p>

<p>
No. 1 informed me that he was an honest man, the
only one indeed to be found in the place; would I step
inside his shop and see the wares, that were very good
and ridiculously cheap; he also very kindly and emphatically
warned me against dealing with the man
over the way, “one d—— big thief!” No. 2 came up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
and vituperated No. 1: told me that the articles offered
were worthless, but that <i>his</i> shop, &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 3 next
arrived on the scene, and in a patronizing tone vilified
Nos. 1 and 2; they were both thieves, and in league to
cheat me. At length, sick at heart, I took refuge in
my conveyance and drove home, sending my servant
for the articles I required, a thing that I ought to have
done at first.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing was on a par with the mercantile
qualifications of a native who once sold a bird to a friend
of mine on the Upper Congo, and who, by way of summing
up all the warbler’s good qualities, exclaimed,—
</p>

<p>
“Father cock, mother cock, sing from three in the
morning till late at night—so help me!”
</p>

<p>
All Calcutta was wrapt at night time in impenetrable
gloom; I occasionally drove to the Barrackpore end of
the town, the deserted streets only lit by the faint glimmer
of an occasional oil lamp, and the stillness broken
now and again by a troop of jackals yelling, and then
scampering off, as if pursued by the Prince of Darkness.
On such occasions one of the troop is supposed to say—and
it certainly sounds remarkably like it—“I smell the
body of a dead Hindoo,” when the rest join in with,
“Whe-re, whe-re, whe-re!” in a very shrill voice.
</p>

<p>
Of places of amusement, theatres and the like, there
seemed absolutely none. I soon discovered too that
<i>everything</i> in the East was diametrically opposed to our
Western notions, and, among other instances, it was
customary for new arrivals to call on the residents, instead
of <i>vice versa</i>, as at home.
</p>

<p>
I derived much amusement from the spectacle afforded
by a ball, where the dancers of both sexes partook for
the most part of the “shadowed livery of the burnished
sun.” White dresses and gay colours contrasted rather
strangely on the female form divine, though evening
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
dress was not altogether unbecoming on the males. The
women were, on the whole, remarkably good-looking,
and displayed faultless figures, as well as being very
graceful dancers. They also had an eye to the main
chance, and were somewhat less reserved on such matters
than is sanctioned by the usages of society elsewhere;
and an old chum told me that a coloured beauty, with
whom he had danced several times during the evening,
without being aware of having held her more tightly
than usual, murmured to him, as she was leaving,
“Why for you squeeze my chumrah (skin) and not
propose me matrimony?”
</p>

<p>
Bad as Calcutta was from a sanitary point of view, it
would have been ten times worse but for the huge army
of nature’s scavengers that swarmed in the atmosphere,
chief among which were the kites and crows. But the
most dignified was the <i>Argala</i>, or “Adjutant,” a wading
bird, not unlike the stork, especially in its preference
for human society. This species particularly affected
the roof of Government House. They are about five
feet high, and their head and neck almost destitute of
feathers; and the beak is so large as to enable them to
seize and swallow a dead cat or bandicoot.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The new arrival in the East has, it will be seen, much
to see and learn, and still more to unlearn. He buys
his experience at a considerable cost, for, although the
sky may change, the mind is too indelibly stamped with
old impressions for them to be easily effaced. For some
time he is a very helpless being, tossed about in a sea of
trouble, and dependent for assistance on those around
him.
</p>

<p>
I most unexpectedly came across kind friends, else I
should indeed have felt a fish out of water. They have
joined the great majority—peace to their souls!

<p class="post">
Just as I was getting more reconciled to the new order
of things it was ordained that I should move farther
south; move, too, in light marching order, for the dogs
of war were already astir in a land flowing with milk
and honey, the inhabitants of which professed that
wonderful faith that takes its name from Buddha, about
which I shall have more to say anon.
</p>

<p>
A week’s steaming brought us to Rangoon, the then
head-quarters of the conquering army, which was located
within a stockade several miles in circumference, protected
by a deep, broad ditch, then upright massive
timbers backed by earthwork eight feet broad. The
story of its capture is too well known to bear repetition.
</p>

<p>
I now found myself confronted with a new phase of
Eastern life, and on the whole infinitely preferred it to
what I had just quitted: the one was civilization grafted,
so to speak, on an alien stock; the other was to all
appearance still the abode of “primeval primitiveness.”
</p>

<p>
There were, of course, many—those especially with
wives and children far away—who thought otherwise;
and while some regretted the comforts of civilization,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
which they never appreciated until they had experienced
the want of them, there were others who pined for the
soothing influence of female society.
</p>

<p>
The space enclosed by the stockade was sufficiently
large to accommodate all the barracks, besides affording
room for short walks and rides. It was also possible to
venture a short distance beyond, though the unsettled
state of the country rendered it the height of imprudence
to travel far; indeed, a friend and myself, who had ridden
on one occasion to a native village beyond the vast
plantation of Jack-fruit and pine-apples, gathered from
the unmistakably hostile proceedings of the inhabitants
that discretion was the better part of valour, and urged
our ponies somewhat precipitously homeward.
</p>

<p>
I have called Burmah a land “flowing with milk and
honey,” in allusion to Nature’s prodigality in the animal,
vegetable, and, in all probability, mineral kingdoms,
though the resources of the underground wealth had at
that time but little prospect of speedy development.
</p>

<p>
In comparison with its area, the country was very
sparsely populated, the majority of its inhabitants living
on the immediate banks of its many rivers, and leaving
hundreds of square miles in undisputed possession of the
most luxuriant forests and the creatures that lived
therein.
</p>

<p>
There was only as much in the way of cultivation as
just ministered to their immediate wants, which were
the most modest, the more so, as they were for the most
part vegetarians, and the soil and climate brought forth
abundantly with a minimum of trouble.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, the ubiquitous <i>bamboo</i> furnished material
for their dwellings, for holding water, and a host of other
purposes. The bamboo stands, indeed, in much the
same relation to the Burmese as coal to us, and any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
cessation in the supply would be attended with consequences
scarcely less calamitous.
</p>

<p>
The pine and custard-apples, plantain or banana,
and Jack-fruit grow to perfection.
</p>

<p>
A well-grown and thoroughly ripe custard-apple,
eaten when just ready to fall to pieces on the slightest
provocation, is certainly a pleasant and enticing fruit,
which may be eaten with impunity, but which, like the
rose, is not without its thorn, in the shape of a very
unpleasant after-taste. The hills on the right bank of
the Irrawaddy, opposite Prome, were celebrated for
them, and the plantations, tastefully laid out, formed
quite a feature in the landscape.
</p>

<p>
The plantain of the East, or banana of the West,
grows to perfection in Burmah; those of Bengal are
vastly inferior, while those grown under glass in this
country are sickly exotics, forming but a very poor
substitute for that which they pretend to be.
</p>

<p>
The Jack-fruit did not commend itself to the palate
of Europeans: in smell and taste it closely resembles
the <i>durian</i>, which abounds in the Malay Archipelago.
The taste of both resembles that of the Jargonelle pear;
and both, strange to say, smell like rotten eggs.
</p>

<p>
There was a perfect forest of Jack-fruit trees extending
many miles to the west of the stockade. This was
a favourite resort, both on account of its numerous shady
groves, in which the pine-apple grew in wild luxuriance,
and by reason of the number and variety of birds,
reptiles, insects, etc., which it afforded to the observant
naturalist.
</p>

<p>
To ride or walk there required, however, some degree
of caution. Below lurked scorpions and snakes; above,
running along the branches, were numbers of very large
and fierce black ants, furnished with formidable nippers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
which they did not hesitate to use most effectually
whenever they chanced to alight on the nape of one’s
neck.
</p>

<p>
The fruit of these trees sometimes attains to an
enormous size; one suspended at either extremity of a
bamboo being as much as a strong man could carry.
</p>

<p>
Another creature that abounded in these forests was
the kalong, or flying fox, a large bat, which sleeps the
whole day, hanging head downwards from the branches,
to which it clings with hooked claws.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could, perhaps, be more marked than the
differences, both physical and mental, that exist between
the Burmese and the Hindoos and Mohammedans of
India. They have not a single feature in common—customs,
religion, ways of thinking are equally different.
Burmah, as it was—for I know not how far the conquering
hand may have altered the spirit of its dream since
I knew it—was infinitely preferable. The pages of history
furnish us with proofs as abundant as they are sad,
that no nation can advance as long as the hand of the
conqueror weighs it down; there may be a spasmodic
and artificial progress, but in reality the conquered races
recede, since there is in the East no possibility of their
absorbing and assimilating their conquerors, as did the
Greeks and Saxons of old, which is the only chance of
their deriving lasting benefit from the victors.
</p>

<p>
It would be about as easy “to make a silk purse out
of a sow’s ear” as to bring aborigines round to our
way of thinking and acting; they acquire the vices of
the dominant power, but unhesitatingly eschew its
virtues.
</p>

<p>
In the days that I am recalling, the Burmese were by
no means faultless, yet they acted up to their own idea
of the eternal fitness of things; and were, I doubt not,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
happier in their way, under their own form of government,
bad as we profess to consider it, than under
ours.
</p>

<p>
Men and women were alike characterized by an
independence of spirit, the like of which I have never
yet encountered in any other race; they absolutely
scorned any form of menial employment, so that Burmese
domestics were then unknown. This was sheer
love of freedom, and not merely the pride attaching to
caste, which has no existence in Burmah; their independence
was visible in every action, so the yoke must
bow these haughty necks very low.
</p>

<p>
In average intelligence, too, they are infinitely above
most of the inhabitants of Hindostan: while the latter
would merely pass one by with a “salaam,” the Burmese
used frequently to stop and speak, perchance asking for
a light, and always evincing the most undisguised
gratification if you but let them have a peep at the
mechanism of your watch.
</p>

<p>
The physical advantages are scarcely less striking;
the men are not handsome, and the women may be far
from pretty, but the former were sturdy, muscular
specimens of humanity, and the latter possessed a good
figure and a striking head of raven hair, and were
besides extremely graceful.
</p>

<p>
Both were seen to the best advantage when trooping
<i>en masse</i> to the pagoda with offerings to “Gautama,”
the most imposing sight of its kind that I ever witnessed
in the East.
</p>

<p>
All were scrupulously clean, and dressed in their best,
while the women set off the blackness of their hair by
interlacing with it the blossoms of a white, waxy flower.
</p>

<p>
A little in advance of each group marched a <i>Pongyee</i>,
a priest or monk, sounding a loud gong; otherwise the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
silence was unbroken. One remarked a total absence
of the drumming, shouting, dancing, and general turmoil
that characterize most religious rites in India,
rendering them an unmitigated nuisance, for they
necessitate police supervision and sanitary precautions
on an extensive scale. On these occasions the sexes
were separated, the men and women marching on
different sides of the road, both going and returning.
</p>

<p>
Their code of morality was said to be of a not very
exalted order; but, I blush to own it, this has become
much a matter of opinion—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“And two in fifty scarce agree</p>
<p>On what is pure morality.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
Anyhow, they can in all probability compare very
favourably in this respect with any other Oriental
nation, and, for the matter of that, with many a European
one.
</p>

<p>
Their detractors, or rather the preachers of the disinterested
process of civilization, have made capital out
of their practice of parting with their daughters for a
pecuniary consideration; but this came into vogue only
when the European arrived on the scene and offered
prices for the girls that to their simple fathers appeared
fabulous.
</p>

<p>
Nor, in their opinion, did the transaction cast the
slightest slur on the young lady’s character, since she
was always at liberty to return home and resume her
old place in the family, if such were the desire of the
principal parties concerned. Moreover, Anglo-Indians
are—I apologize, <i>were</i>—unfortunately among those
who, in some encounters at all events, could not afford
to throw stones; it used to be emphatically impressed
upon young ladies that a civilian was worth so much,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
“dead or alive;” while the market-value of a military
man was fixed at considerably less.
</p>

<p>
Marriage was represented to them as a mere matter
of <i>£</i> <i>s.</i> <i>d.</i>, a form of social barter; they were to pass
by the “red coat” on principle, concentrating all their
blandishments on the “black” one. In our insufferable
egotism, which drivelling patriots dignify with the name
of insular pride, we are very apt to lay down a code of
ethics for others, without thinking it at all necessary to
practise the morality we preach.
</p>

<p>
As is customary in the East, most of the work fell to
the lot of the women, their lords and masters only condescending
to lend a helping hand whenever resources
threatened to fail. The besetting vice of the Burmese
was gambling and betting, as much, in fact, a part and
parcel of their nature as with “Mr. John Chinaman;”
on the whole, indeed, I am of opinion that they cast the
Celestial into the shade. At a certain popular boat-race
I remember sitting beside a Burmese of some
position, whose proceedings were veritably those of a
lunatic; he danced and cried, he undid his long black
hair and tried to pull it out.
</p>

<p>
I too, so he deigned to inform me, should have
behaved likewise, if I had had such a bet on the race as
he. In reply to my interrogation as to the extent
of this wonderful bet that appeared so to affect him—“What
have I betted? Oh! only my wife, children,
house, clothes and furniture!” He positively lost all,
and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Cock-fighting was another amusement at which large
parties would gladly assemble. The birds came of a
good stock, were large, heavy, well-spurred, and carefully
bred, with, as I suspected, a strain of the “jungle-fowl,”
a shapely bird, which abounds in the jungle,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
though difficult to get at on foot, and which, if hung
for the proper time, eats as well as pheasant.
</p>

<p>
The fanciers, each with his bird under his arm, would
resort of an evening to any convenient shady spot, clear
a ring, and set to work amid prodigious excitement.
One never, perhaps, thoroughly grasped the utter
brutality of this sport until he had seen it practised by
those poor “savages;” in this case, however, it would
have been too glaring a case of “glass houses,” etc., etc.,
to have even criticized it!
</p>

<p>
The one physical exercise of which the Burmese had
but a very imperfect idea was the art of horse-riding.
As they used very short stirrups, and consequently kept
their knees right above the saddle, their seat was extremely
insecure, only practicable indeed at the “amble,”
a pace peculiar to their ponies, horses being unknown.
</p>

<p>
The European eye measured the qualities of that
indigenous animal, with the result of soon placing it
beyond the reach of ordinary mortals. I bought one
for 3<i>l.</i>; in five years the price rose to 30<i>l.</i> In fact,
one of those crazes for which our society is famous,
took that direction; it suffered from “Pegu ponies” on
the brain, talked of them, dreamed of them.
</p>

<p>
The enthusiasm of Phaeton the ill-starred to emulate
Jehu was scarcely greater or more unfortunate than that
of all sorts and conditions of both sexes to drive a pair
in a well-appointed, low carriage.
</p>

<p>
They were certainly well-bred animals, yet withal
most docile; many a night did mine carry me home
with unerring instinct, when, owing to a darkness that
could be felt, I could not see his head.
</p>

<p>
The natives looked with undisguised amazement on
our cavalry and artillery horses: to begin with, the
process of mounting sorely puzzled them. Later on,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
when it was decided to weed them out, a few, sold by
auction, came into the possession of ambitious and
adventurous Burmese, one of whom I watched with
great amusement in his fruitless endeavours to mount.
The climax was reached when, in despair, he tied the
animal to one of the posts of his verandah, and climbing
over the railing from inside, lowered himself into the
saddle. Delighted beyond measure at the success of
his stratagem, he cautiously proceeded to “cast adrift,”
and doubtless enjoyed a famous ride, of which the
element of excitement was by no means the least
attraction.
</p>

<p>
There was a peculiar kind of football in which these
people excelled, which in so far resembled our own
“Association” that the use of the hands was strictly
forbidden. There, however, the resemblance ceased:
the ball, about the size of those used at croquet, was
constructed of strips of cane, and consequently very
light; some thirty players would form a large circle,
and would keep the ball going from one to another,
with toes, heels, and knees, with wonderful skill and
accuracy.
</p>

<p>
But the most striking of their national amusements
was the theatrical performance known as a “Pooay,”
which was given in a kind of large “Punch and Judy”
show.
</p>

<p>
Seats were literally <i>taken</i> early; that is to say, every
one brought a brick, deposited the same according to
fancy, and forthwith squatted upon it.
</p>

<p>
The <i>dramatis personæ</i> were dolls dexterously manipulated
by a complicated arrangement of wires, while
the men behind proved no mean ventriloquists; the
performance, too, was as lengthy as it was excellent, for
I have seen the audience assemble of an evening, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
break up when I have passed that way again <i>next
morning</i>!
</p>

<p>
Any clever joke would be received with uproarious
mirth, and—let the reader be lenient in his judgment of
these poor, untaught savages!—the broader the allusion,
the more they relished it.
</p>

<p>
Comparisons are, as a rule, odious, but the pharisaical
suppression of many native Burmese modes of recreation
gives rise to reflections that will find expression ere long
in the outcry of an injured people. We lay the flattering
unction to our souls that we are not as others; <i>we</i>,
forsooth, forbid the natives to bet and gamble. Why
can we not at least have the honesty to admit that we hold
India and Burmah solely and entirely for the sake of the
“loaves and fishes,” without descending to cant about
our duty as the pioneers of a religion with which such
races can have but little real sympathy, and a civilization
that—if, indeed, it be nothing worse—is at least no
improvement on their present state?
</p>

<p>
The new arrival is at once struck by the large number
of places of worship scattered broadcast over the country.
They generally culminate in a pagoda, a wonderful
tapering structure, very solidly built, and covered from
the base upwards with gold-leaf, while the apex is generally
surmounted by an umbrella, the insignia of royalty,
or some other fantastic device. They were built in
honour of Buddha, the labour and material being voluntary
gifts of the people. If offerings of produce could
be relied on as a measure of their devotion, then were
the Burmese an essentially religious people. Plantains,
boiled rice, curiously concocted native dishes, flowers,
umbrellas—all were presented in profusion, and all—not
excepting the more perishable portion of even the umbrellas—were
disposed of by swarms of crows, the more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
adventurous of which pounced upon the good things
while the worshippers were still busy with their devotions.
</p>

<p>
Of the many wondrous natural phenomena that so
puzzle us Europeans in the far East, the extraordinary
instinct possessed by vultures and other birds of prey is
by no means the most inconsiderable. But a few
moments need elapse after a bullock falls dead on the
march, and one already sees black spots not far above
the horizon, which soon prove to be vultures making
straight for the carcase with unerring precision. Naturalists
are divided in opinion as to whether this extraordinary
power of perception owes its origin to some
unusual development of the sense of vision, or to an
equally unintelligible transcendency of the olfactory
organs: one fact, I believe, speaks strongly in favour of
the former hypothesis, and that is, that the birds as often
as not approach from windward.
</p>

<p>
The numerous roadside temples offered unlimited
opportunities for “looting,” the panacea for all military
hardships; though the occasions were indeed better than
the prizes, which consisted for the most part of images
of Gautama covered with gold and silver foil.
</p>

<p>
All is, I imagine, fair in war; though in how far that
rule admits of modification in the case of a war declared
by a dominant power against a race of half-naked
Orientals, I do not care to inquire. The Burmese
certainly bore the pillage of their temples in a philosophic
spirit, not to be met with even in a Christian
country; they bowed to the inevitable, they made a
virtue of necessity, they trusted to the teachings of their
faith, rendering good for evil, so as to ultimately reach
Nirvana, the goal of all their earthly and spiritual
ambition, in the hope of which life was alone worth
living.

CHAPTER V.
<br />
FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“He hears, alas! no music of the spheres,</p>
<p>But an unhallowed, earthly sound of fiddling.”</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“A spark neglected makes a mighty fire.”</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="post">
These temples were by no means good specimens of
Burmese architecture, which perhaps culminated in the
<i>Kyoungs</i>, or resorts of the priests: a large quantity of
elaborately carved timber entered into the construction
of these edifices, the roof of which gradually diminished
from below upwards, and were on this account far more
pleasing to the eye than the more abrupt style adopted
in Chinese temples.
</p>

<p>
They were for the most part raised in quiet and
secluded groves, whither the pious <i>Pongyees</i> could retire
for purposes of contemplation, in humble imitation of
the founder of their creed.
</p>

<p>
These <i>Pongyees</i>, who were always clean-shaven, and
clad in yellow robes, transcended in purity of life and
devotion to their sacred cause any others of like persuasion
that I ever came across. They were, moreover,
courteous, unassuming, and affable to a degree, always
ready to impart any information that lay within their
ken, and supporting it with such written documents as
they possessed.
</p>

<p>
The people at large held them in the greatest veneration,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
and the funeral obsequies of any distinguished
member of the order were of an elaborate and somewhat
costly nature. The first process was the embalming, in
which art the Burmese must have been little inferior to
the ancient Egyptians. When this process had been
completed and the limbs were bound up and covered
with a kind of varnish, the body was placed in a <i>kyoung</i>,
where it lay in state for a month or six weeks, during
which time there was always a light burning within the
building, while prayers, intercessions, and offerings of
every kind were made by devotees from all parts.
</p>

<p>
The last rite of all, cremation, I had the good
fortune to witness, on a very important occasion, amid
a large concourse of worshippers. The mummified
remains were reverently laid on an iron grating between
two low parallel walls, and a fire was ignited below, fuel
being added as required; and although the wood was
dry, and both it and the body burned furiously, the latter
took a considerable time to incinerate.
</p>

<p>
While the deceased was lying in state, some foolish
Europeans, possessed, I regret to say, of more zeal than
honesty, made off one night with a few of his ornaments,
and escaped only by the skin of their teeth.
</p>

<p>
Thus, even to Burmese philosophy there was a limit;
they could endure with stoical indifference the spoliation
of their temples; they uttered no audible protest against
the unholy appropriation of pagodas sacred to Buddha,
“the Wise,” “the Enlightened,” but when their offerings
for the repose of a high priest’s soul were surreptitiously
made away with, then their anger was kindled. The
images were coveted, not for their intrinsic value, but
because they were clever caricatures of the invader, both
the civil and the military element being represented.
Thus the resentment of the marauder predominated over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
even his cupidity; though no one who knew the character
of the Burmese could ever suppose for one moment
that they intended this as an insult, for, being themselves
almost proof against the shafts of ridicule, they not unnaturally
concluded that a nation so superior in intellect
would be above such trifles. And here they erred; their
intercourse with Europeans had hitherto been fragmentary—limited
to a casual trader, and it had consequently
never dawned on them that the sensitiveness of
a race varies directly with its organization.
</p>

<p>
But for the stockade, the pilferers’ chance of escape
would have been small indeed, and even as it was, they
reached the main gate not a moment too soon. The
sentry on duty shut it in the faces of the enraged pursuers
and called out the guard. By restoring the images,
and vouchsafing some sort of explanation, an episode
which might have been attended with serious consequences
was thus happily tided over.
</p>

<p>
I have already contrasted the Burmese with the
natives of Hindostan, and I am constrained to compare
them with the <i>Mongolidæ</i>. They closely resemble the
Chinese in their features and habits; their language,
too, is monosyllabic, and they also remain in a stationary
condition for all time. This latter feature of their
national existence is due to the generosity of nature;
we northern races are engaged in an everlasting pitched
battle with the elements, and where nature adds difficulty
she adds brain; but with a warm climate, an abundant
fauna and flora, rivers teeming with fish, and just enough
intelligence to appreciate these gifts, besides a religion
which fitted in with their mode of thought, what need
had the Burmese of progress?
</p>

<p>
Their misfortune lay in being interfered with, because
they did not understand the customs of what we are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
pleased to call “civilization,” and their country was
wrested from them in consequence by the superior force
of might. The rubbish indulged in as regards “improving
and elevating them” I have but little patience
with; it is, in the first place, right down dishonest, and
it is, moreover, impossible even were it desirable.
</p>

<p>
In the “commercial advantages,” which were—let us
be frank—the mainspring of the whole movement, there
figured largely certain mines that had for years dazzled
our eyes and excited our thirst for gain: well, we took
them as the price of our “improvements,” and how have
they been manipulated?
</p>

<p>
I have already had occasion to discuss the variety and
strength of Oriental smells; one could, in fact, very well
do without the sense of smell while in the East; the
scent even of the flowers, of mango, orange, lime, and
dedonia, is oppressive in the sultry atmosphere. But
the “artificial” smells are something to experience;
that of an Indian bazaar—a compound of assafœtida,
decayed produce, and stagnant drains—clings to a person
for ever; that of a Burmese market is delightfully
enhanced by the perfume of Gua-pu, a speciality of the
country, in which stale fish, lime, and other similar
ingredients are incorporated <i>secundum artem</i>.
</p>

<p>
The display in the Rangoon market included meat,
fish, poultry, fruit, vegetables, and flowers, in variety and
abundance; but every other odour was assimilated and
overcome by Gua-pu. Yet who shall ridicule so acquired
a taste?
</p>

<p>
The alderman likes his green turtle, the Chinaman
his birds’ nests, and the Frenchman his frogs’ legs; so,
too, the Burmese will have his Gua-pu.
</p>

<p>
The fact is, there is Gua-pu and Gua-pu!
</p>

<p>
On one occasion, proceeding up the river with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
Commissioner, the late Sir A. Phayre, I was roundly
abusing this native delicacy; he fetched a stone jar and
begged that I would taste the contents. When I had
done so and reported favourably, he informed me to my
astonishment that it was a superior quality of the
compound I had been vilifying. Had he not been so
perfect a gentleman, and so considerate to all that had
the pleasure of acting under him, I should have suspected
that he inwardly enjoyed my obvious discomfiture at
having so erroneously condemned anything <i>in toto</i>.
</p>

<p>
He was certainly far above the ordinary run of rulers
in all those qualities that adorn a man and a Christian.
It was my good fortune to be near him for weeks together,
when heavy responsibilities weighed upon him:
we had to traverse wild tracts of country with dangers
at every turn, and the end—if ever reached—bristled
with difficulties. To be acquainted with him was a
matter for congratulation; to serve under him was a
privilege; to know him was to love him.
</p>

<p>
When circumstances had parted us, I had very undesirable
occasions for studying the reverse of the medal—egotistical,
fussy, fault-finding men, to please whom
was beyond the range of human attainment; men primed
with theory, but worse than useless in practical administration,
whose one object seemed to be to offend and
estrange their fellow-countrymen, and to oppress and
outrage the natives.
</p>

<p>
The one type elevated the service; the other lowered
both the service and all concerned therein, causing the
tide to ebb to a very low mark.
</p>

<p>
The words of the Bard concerning the good and evil
deeds of mankind have no application to the lamented
Commissioner; he left no evil deeds to survive him, nor
were his many good ones lost with him, for as long as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
Burmah is inhabited—and there is not at present any very
startling prospect of a decrease in its population—his
memory will be revered by Native and European
alike, a monument more lasting than stone or brass.
</p>

<p>
For a conquered race the Burmese certainly held
their heads remarkably erect, looking the usurper
straight in the face without any shame for their own
position. The fact was, a very superficial acquaintance
with our habits and mode of living had convinced them
of our superiority in every respect—save one.
</p>

<p>
It is very curious that every Eastern native looks
down on our music with undisguised contempt. Our
bands might discourse the gems of Chopin, Beethoven,
and Balfe, but only the veriest loiterer would stop to
listen, and, to judge by his expression, it fell as flat on
his ear as a penny trumpet would on ours.
</p>

<p>
Real music was too refined and complicated for
nerves accustomed throughout generations to coarser
measures in harmony. This was the same all over Hindostan;
and it is therefore surprising that our regimental
native bands were remarkably good before the Mutiny.
</p>

<p>
A Burmese band consisted of a number of drums in a
circle, and diverse brass instruments, awful to look upon,
and still more awful to hear; though what they lacked
in harmony they certainly made up for in noise. With
the exception of the ubiquitous and irrepressible mosquito,
the whole of the lower creation fled before it;
and only a sense of dignity prevented many of us from
following suit.
</p>

<p>
The performers must have been animated by extraordinary
zeal, if the manner in which they hammered
on the drums and blew through the wind-instruments
be any criterion. As I invariably hastened in a direction
opposite to that which was taken by the performers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
I never witnessed the climax of the celebration; but if
it continued for long on the same <i>crescendo</i> principle as
that with which it passed me, I should think it must
ultimately have resulted in rupture of the drum-heads
and explosion of the remaining instruments.
</p>

<p>
The effect of music on nations, and through
them on individuals, certainly furnishes matter for a
deal of interesting study and comparison. In the
primitive state it is simple and natural: Eastern
nations make use of it to produce temporary excitement,
a method that we have retained in our military
bands, or, combined with dancing, as the food of love.
</p>

<p>
It has always been inseparably connected with
religion and religious observances, from the organ and
choir of Western religions to the drum and cymbals of
the East. If the imagination of the poet can give to
“airy nothing a local habitation and a name,” music
has a yet greater power; and they are indeed twin
sisters, poetry and music raising the civilized mind far
above the ordinary range of things earthly. There will
doubtless always be some mortals, even in the highest
stage of civilization, who are nowise susceptible to the
beauties of music; of them our poet for all time has
spoken in uncomplimentary terms, perhaps harshly;
but, if such a being is not to blame, he is at least
incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
Among the many disadvantages under which Eastern
nations labour, is the absence of melody in the voices of
the feathered tribe. Our nightingale, thrush, and lark
are all birds of sober plumage; but in the East there
are no vocal artists; no lark poising itself in mid-air
warbling forth in the early morn, and gladdening the
heart of man with its song; no thrush singing to its
lady-love from the topmost branch of a may-tree; no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
nightingale to lend its charm to a summer twilight—nothing
but gaudy plumage and burnished colours that
dart hither and thither “brief as the lightning in the
collied night.”
</p>

<p>
The birds utter for the most part harsh, discordant
sounds; and it appears to me that the reason for this
want of vocal sweetness is to be found either in the
climate or in the number of carrion-eaters. A nightingale,
for instance, singing from the leafy branch of a
tamarind tree, with a pack of jackals yelling beneath,
would be a contrast repugnant to nature, a dislocation
of the fitness of things.
</p>

<p>
Our English vanity enables us to tolerate peacocks in
the gardens of the wealthy. For the sake of seeing
them strut about terraces and spread their tails in the
sunlight, people will endure their torturing cry at daybreak,
and even turn a deaf ear to the complaints of the
gardener, who soon loses all patience with this most
mischievous of birds. I do not remember them in
Burmah, but in India they are very numerous, affecting
in particular the denser jungles frequented by tigers.
</p>

<p>
An idea prevails indeed among the natives that the
peacock follows such animals, but its only foundation
lies in the coincidence that both love solitude. I remember
on one occasion coming upon some hundreds
of these beautiful birds committing rare havoc in a cultivated
field. But they soon took cognizance of the
intruder, and I had only just time to shoot a male and
a young female, when all traces of them had vanished;
the former for the sake of his feathers, the latter for the
table. Certain shady trees bordering a canal near our
encampment turned out to be a favourite roosting-place
for them, but ere they could settle down for the night
a general scrimmage would take place for the best seats:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
fine feathers may make fine birds, but do not always
cover amiable dispositions—not, at least, in the <i>ornithological</i>
biped!
</p>

<p>
Oh, my digressions! You wanted to hear about
Burmah and its inhabitants, and here I have been
discoursing on music and peacocks!
</p>

<p>
Being subject to a heavy annual rainfall, all their
dwellings are built on piles, and are thereby raised to
several feet above the ground. This expedient, a sanitary
precaution against damp floorings and emanations
from the soil, a <i>sine quâ non</i>, in fact, under such
climatic conditions, gave a special character to their
villages, which were constructed for the most part of
bamboos.
</p>

<p>
But while steering clear of Scylla, they ran into
Charybdis. Fire played great havoc with them, and
its annual course was “short, sharp, and decisive.”
The wonder was that it did not occur a dozen times a
year instead of once; and I doubt whether a hydrant
close at hand, with an unlimited supply of water, would
have been of any real service.
</p>

<p>
They never took the least precaution with regard to
fire, although their houses, furniture, and mats, and all
consisted of nothing but bamboo; perhaps they thought
that the annual fire was as inevitable as the annual
monsoon. Indeed—to borrow an illustration from our
own historians of the seventeenth century—I am
strongly of opinion that this annual conflagration stifled
the origin and prevented the spread of epidemic
disease. Witness the fact that, a few years later, when
more substantial buildings had taken the place of these
flimsy wooden structures, thereby reducing such visitations
to a minimum, cholera raged with great virulence,
a disease hitherto almost unknown to the country,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
where doctors had been occupied chiefly with cases of
fever and dysentery.
</p>

<p>
I have known a regiment up to its full strength so
ravaged by these complaints as not to be able to muster
a hundred effective bayonets after a few months’ residence
in a certain part of the country. The annual
incineration of Rangoon therefore possessed a redeeming
feature, and was certainly a “thing of beauty” while
it lasted.
</p>

<p>
Late one evening, in the month of April, the garrison
was roused from its wonted propriety by what appeared
to be a very heavy discharge of artillery and musketry
in the immediate neighbourhood, and the commanding
officer was on the point of calling the troops to arms,
when some one discovered the origin of the alarm—the
yearly fire! The flames literally ran along the streets
faster than the natives could run themselves—the reports
being due to the bursting of sections of bamboo; and
the scene resembled (I ask pardon for seeking my
illustrations in such commonplace sources), a Benefit
display of fireworks at the Crystal Palace, at the moment
when the large set-piece is ignited. It burned itself out,
simply because there was nothing else left to feed upon;
nothing but charred remains, the outcome of a very
short reign of terror.
</p>

<p>
History, sacred and profane, alludes to a bird, sacred
to the dread Osiris, the All-seeing and Many-eyed, that
was said to pay a periodical visit to the land of the
Pharaohs. The most credited account concerning the
bird is that, on burning itself, a similar creature sprang
from its ashes, and, from its hiding-place in the surrounding
tamarisk, continued to watch over the sacred burial-place.
A very phœnix was Rangoon; it rose up on its
own ashes rejuvenated and vigorous; no harrowing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
accounts ever reached us of loss of life or even serious
injury; all went on as before, with increased energy,
until new bamboos had supplied the place of old ones.
</p>

<p>
Equally singular were the circumstances attending
the outbreak of the “monsoon,” which burst upon us,
less to our delight than to that of the vegetable and
insect world. The change was startling. One day, the
baked ground, as hard and bare as a rock, with only a
stray blade of grass struggling for existence; creation
groaning, exhausted, expectant. Then a change comes
over its dream; there is a terrible and steady downpour;
ere twenty-four hours have elapsed, the new
blades of grass can be seen peeping out; there are
innumerable insects on the wing, and millions of frogs
are croaking in the marshes. The evening before I had
passed a dried-up tank of large dimensions, the bottom
of which was deeply fissured in every direction, and to
all appearances as destitute of life as the Great Sahara.
The next day it was full to the brim, and huge fish were
leaping out of the water in evident delight at being
released from their long and enforced captivity.
</p>

<p>
The rain had descended, the mud was softened, and
its inmates, wriggling forth, took to their more natural
element and mode of locomotion. Instances of dormant
vitality we know to be common among seeds and
insects; wheat found in an Egyptian mummy-case
many centuries old has germinated freely; seeds of
trees buried for ages have done the same, and those also
of fruit found in a skeleton, that must have lain incarcerated
since the beginning of the Christian era. The
chrysalis stage of insects is too well known to need
comment. But such a suspension of vitality in creatures
like fish, whose organization demands continual aeration
of the blood through gills, is somewhat strange, and runs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
considerable risk of being branded as a traveller’s tale.
I confess to having felt startled on my first acquaintance
with these mud-fish. Many months of freedom
could now be looked forward to; then again the daily
decrease in depth; wriggling into the mud; diminution
of vitality; and finally, loss of consciousness.
Truly, a strange existence!

The discussion of a national religion is always a delicate
task, but, having so far considered only the physical and
political aspect of the Burmese, I feel that I may no
longer avoid giving some account of their conception of
the universe and the Hereafter, matters with which,
truth to tell, they were wont to trouble themselves less
than any other Eastern nation with which I ever came
in contact.
</p>

<p>
I shall endeavour to convey some idea of their attitude
towards their great teacher, Buddha; and I think that
the reader will share my opinion that the absence of that
fanaticism, so characteristic of the natives of Hindostan,
is a blessing to rulers and ruled alike.
</p>

<p>
The “<i>Contemplative One</i>,” after sacrificing all manner
of brilliant worldly prospects, retiring in lieu thereof
into remote places for the purpose of indulging in holy
meditation, reached his eightieth year, and, having completed
the necessary cycles of transmigration, passed
away to “Complete Nirvana,” the coveted annihilation
and end of all things.
</p>

<p>
Next to him in the cycle came <i>Gautama</i>, to whom
were dedicated the many pagodas and temples found
all over the land.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Their images were of identical conception, no matter
what their material; their attitude was invariably the
same, sitting cross-legged, and contemplating the nether
portion of their body, a pose suggestive of deep thought
and unbounded indifference to the many allurements of
this wicked world.
</p>

<p>
These images varied considerably in size, some
measuring but a few inches, while others were of enormous
dimensions, being occasionally hidden away in
places where one would least expect to find them, the
sole relics, it may be, of some old dwelling over which
the jungle had reasserted a prior claim.
</p>

<p>
There prevails an idea, especially current among those
who are ever ready to class under one and the same
category every creed that differs in source and ceremonial
from their own, that these were idols intended
as a medium through which to address the Deity. This
theory does not do infinite credit to the researches of
those with whom it is in favour, since, in point of fact,
the actual comprehension of a Supreme Being never
having dawned on their minds, the Burmese are atheists
in the true sense of the word.
</p>

<p>
No; this excessive multiplication of images took its
origin from another motive, not a very creditable one,
perhaps, but nevertheless forced upon them in a great
measure by the despotic form of government under
which they lived.
</p>

<p>
Regular taxation in proportion to wealth being unknown
among them, the ruler of a province in want of
supplies for his own or the public service, proceeded in
a manner not quite unknown to the rulers of more
civilized nations—that is to say, he first discovered the
whereabouts of treasure by secret agency, and then set
about extracting the same by the aid of an armed force.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Suspected individuals, having failed to succumb to
the exigencies of torture, often paid the penalty of their
real or imaginary wealth with their lives; and such
continual insecurity necessarily drove them to other
expedients.
</p>

<p>
In the reign of our first Edward it was found necessary
to pass a statute forbidding landowners to place
their property within “Sanctuary” of the Church without
their king’s consent; and the practice that occasioned
the necessity for this enactment was in a way analogous
to the motives that led to the erection of temples and
images in Burmah. The images of Gautama were
covered with gold and silver foil; and the natives were
somewhat of experts in carpentry and metallurgy, having,
like the Chinese, attained to a certain standard, at which
point their fertility of resource ended.
</p>

<p>
Dedication to Gautama or to Buddha implied one and
the same thing, in spite of the latter having ceased to
exist here and hereafter, while the former was still
undergoing transmigrations as tiger, crow, lizard, or
mosquito. On the whole, therefore, the motive was of
a worldly nature, and any idea that may have existed in
their minds concerning the efficacy of such offerings to
abbreviate the weary stages of transition was certainly
illogical to a degree, considering that they acknowledged
no Superior Being, through whose interposition any such
relaxation could possibly be effected.
</p>

<p>
Their doctrine pointed clearly to a prescribed course
through which all must pass according to their deeds;
even the very best—those ascetics who had been crowned
with all the virtues inculcated in Buddhism—must be
born again and again, though under far more favourable
circumstances than those whose life had been careless
and indifferent. The absolutely wicked would be born
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
again in one of the many hells situated in the centre of
the earth, coming up, perchance, in the form of petroleum,
to be tortured in another form through those
terrible periods, the limits of which were assigned at
billions of years. Billions! Let those think of it whose
religion teaches of an eternity: of the two, the latter, as
being undefined and imaginary, is less perplexing to the
mind, if equally impossible to grasp.
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of transmigration is essentially an
Eastern one. That remarkable people, the Egyptians,
with their inbred polytheism—their divinities, Ptah,
Osiris, Isis, Horus, and many others, not to mention a
still greater number of “companion-gods,”—were confirmed
believers in it. Hence arose the practice of
embalming, the idea being, that the soul, having in a
period of several thousands of years completed the
wanderings assigned to it, might return to its original
dwelling, to be absorbed in Osiris, the manifestation of
Light.
</p>

<p>
The practice, which dates from very remote antiquity,
is frequently alluded to in the Scriptures. Joseph commanded
his servants to embalm his father; and he in
his turn was similarly embalmed, having died at the
very respectable age of one hundred and ten years, and
placed in a sarcophagus.
</p>

<p>
One frequently hears the doctrine of transmigration
attributed to Pythagoras; but we might with about
as much reason credit the Pope with the invention of
the Old Testament! The Philosopher merely imbibed
the notion from the Egyptians, and, as it appeared in
harmony with his own system, he carried it back to
Europe and spread it among his converts.
</p>

<p>
In Hinduism too, a religion that recognizes three
gods—Brahma, the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
Siva, the Destroyer—metempsychosis is paramount. An
ordinary life being too brief a span for the completion of
a mortal’s allotted task, he had to be born again as
often as necessary for the fulfilment of whatever remained
for him to perform.
</p>

<p>
Not many years ago a severe epidemic broke out in
a certain district of India, almost depopulating that
part of the country, which the year following was
subject to an extraordinary visitation of rats. The
authorities having, as in duty bound, made arrangements
for the speedy extermination of these pests,
the Brahmans interposed in their behalf, on the plea
that the souls of departed were thus revisiting their
old haunts, guided thither by the force of association.
</p>

<p>
For the same reason a high-caste Brahman will
neither kill anything himself, nor will he eat anything
that has succumbed to a violent death, be it flesh, fish,
or fowl. Life to him is sacred in all its many forms, for
therein may reside the troubled spirit of a departed
relative.
</p>

<p>
An old friend of mine, a Brahman of exceeding
uprightness and more than ordinary intelligence,
constantly upbraided me with the sinful cruelty of
shooting and fishing. Out of my great respect for
him, I bore his harangues with a patient shrug, worthy
of Shylock, knowing full well that any attempt to
argue the point would be worse than useless; for
it would be easier to train an old oak, high-top bald
with dry antiquity, as an espalier or cordon, than to
influence such a one to the extent of “the twentieth
part of one poor scruple,” the more so, that he was
consistently acting up to his own belief.
</p>

<p>
The children of Nature who hunted the buffalo in the
prairies of the Far West do not appear to have entertained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
any serious idea of transmigration; they looked
death boldly in the face, believing it to be a mere
translation to happier hunting-grounds.
</p>

<p>
The Incas of Peru worshipped everything that appeared
in the vault of heaven, including sun, moon, stars,
lightning, and rainbow, and their worship was as devout
as it was original.
</p>

<p>
The moon was regarded as the spouse of him from
whom she derives her light; Venus was her attendant,
and the remaining heavenly bodies ranked as inferior
deities. But it was to the sun that their attention was
principally directed; in his honour a temple was erected
at the seat of government, wherein sat enthroned his
image, on which his own rays impinged with great effect.
It is scarcely to be wondered at that the idea of transmigration
took such hold upon a considerable section of
the human race, especially if one considers the climatic
and physical conditions under which Eastern nations
have existed throughout all ages.
</p>

<p>
We go out there full of life and spirits, and manage
to derive some compensating pleasure out of riding,
driving, sport, and sundry national games. To the native,
however, life is “tedious as a twice-told tale;” essentially
apathetic beyond a certain monotonous routine,
he never ceases to wonder how we can find pleasure in
such physical exercise; and death itself can have but
few terrors for those who only endure existence in the
hope of something better.
</p>

<p>
Who knows whether, were it not for more smiling
conditions of existence, added to the aspirations of a
higher faith, we too might not welcome the prospect of
entering another state?
</p>

<p>
Buddha, unlike Mohammed, tasted the pleasures of
this life for thirty years as only the son of a king and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
husband of a princess could; but the unrestrained
gratification of his desires seem only to have added fuel
to the fire that smouldered within him, for he rejected
them all as totally unsatisfactory. Then followed the
period of his retirement in the fastnesses of his native
mountains, where he endeavoured to work out the origin
and remedy of pain, sorrow, sickness, and all the evils
flesh is heir to. Having arrived at satisfactory conclusions,
he commenced to preach. At first his converts
were few, but in time the rivulets united to form that
mighty stream which covered the whole of India, Burmah,
and China.
</p>

<p>
Mohammed, on the other hand, lived a hard and
somewhat chequered life throughout, and was further
advanced in life when the pseudo-revelation changed
the current of his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
As in every other respect, the two religions differed
greatly in the means employed to disseminate them;
the teachings of the Light of Asia seemed to flow on
throughout the length and breadth of the land as a great
stream with unruffled surface, acquiring strength and
durability by appealing to the fairer side of humanity;
Mohammedanism resembled rather a mountain torrent
bubbling and fretting at every turn, promulgated moreover
amid all the attendant miseries of savage war.
</p>

<p>
The early life and bringing up of Buddha would naturally
lead one to suppose that he was a highly educated
man; yet, strange to say, no traces of his writings have
been discovered, even supposing that he ever committed
his thoughts to such an ordeal, in order that his followers
might not forget them after he had passed away.
</p>

<p>
More worldly wise was Mohammed, who, either in his
own handwriting or in that of an amanuensis, left behind
him a copy of that wonderful compilation, the Koran,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
as well as the severe ritual, setting forth the number
of prayers, the long, trying fasts, the extent of charity in
money and produce, and the pilgrimages to the holy city
of Mecca, with their attendant ceremonies, including the
sevenfold circuit of the Black Stone.
</p>

<p>
The Anglo-Indian has daily opportunity of observing
how faithfully these religious observances are carried out
in the face of many obstacles, but his admiration will not
be unmixed with relief at the comparatively slight hold
this creed of fanaticism has taken on the natives of
Hindostan.
</p>

<p>
The remissness of Buddha in not committing to
writing his many and valuable teachings was amply
atoned for by his followers; and, as in many other
religions, the numeral 3 seems to predominate in the
ordering of their rites.
</p>

<p>
“All good things,” says the German, “are of that
number;” and this superstition seems to have derived
its origin from the doctrines of the world’s creeds. We
have the Trinity. The Egyptians divided their gods
into three sets; thought, word, and deed formed the
Peruvian triad; so, too, the flowery language of the
East is exemplified by the pious Buddhist’s “Triple
Basket.”
</p>

<p>
The fountain-head of every misfortune lies, according
to the teachings of Buddha, in having been born into
this world at all, in expressing which opinion the “Contemplative
One” spoke, at all events, in direct defiance
of all law where recent causes are always preferred to
those more remote.
</p>

<p>
This unfortunate beginning necessitates a frequent
repetition of the same process under different forms,
animate or inanimate, the great aim of this life being to
attain “Complete Nirvana,” of which, however, only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
those seem to have the least chance who from the first
embrace a religious and ascetic life.
</p>

<p>
The strict code of discipline left no loophole for the
indulgence of that which is earthly in thought, word, or
deed: terrible self-denial in food, raiment, and dwelling
was incumbent; one meal a day, and that a gift; rags
covered with a yellow cloth; the shade of a friendly
tree—these constitute the sole conception of earthly
luxury permitted to the good Buddhist. Sleep, too,
must be indulged in, not extended at full length, but in
a sitting posture; and systematic contemplation on the
best remedies for worldly evils was to abstract the mind
from its desires and affections.
</p>

<p>
The march of time has naturally brought with it many
relaxations in this terrible code, and, as with most other
nations, practice has fallen very short of theory.
</p>

<p>
It is no easy matter to picture the city of Benares,
now the head-quarters of Brahminical bigotry, as the
stronghold of Buddhism, yet relics are not wanting to
point to this as the true order of succession. Somewhat
singular, too, is the process by which this most
ancient of religions was driven from the continent
right and left, taking a last refuge at its extremities—the
Himalayas on the one hand, Ceylon on the other.
Thibet, Bhootan, and Nepaul are essentially Buddhist,
and, along with two-thirds of China, it is, in spite of its
having been ousted from India proper, still numerically
superior to any other religion.
</p>

<p>
The medium through which it so successfully marched
over the greater portion of the East appears to have
been zealous, indefatigable missionary enterprise; one
reason for its many victories was its non-aggressive
character and its fundamental doctrine inculcating
respect for other creeds. The absence of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
forbearance among us, and among Western missionaries
generally, may in part account for our own
want of success in spreading Christianity in the
East.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, their own religions have long since taken
too firm a hold. An old and respected friend of mine,
who had laboured in this direction for about five-and-thirty
years, told me plainly the strongholds of the two
great religions of India were, so far as the adult population
was concerned, all but impregnable; the only
prospect of a measure of success lies in those orphanages,
the inmates of which are as yet subject to only the
indirect influence of heredity and free from contact
with their co-religionists; once they are back among
their own people, preaching to stones would be about as
effectual. Further, we are not to the manner born;
besides which, our position in the land constitutes an
impediment.
</p>

<p>
Another great and peaceful revolution effected by the
teachings of Buddha was the overthrow of the rigid,
unnatural system of caste. Whatever benefit this order
of things may have been to us in India as a bar to
combination, no other scheme has ever been devised
better calculated to keep men asunder and clog the
wheels of progress. It hampers all enterprise, causing
the machinery of government and industry to creak
along after the fashion of a native bullock-cart.
</p>

<p>
No such arrangement exists in Burmah, and, if only
for this reason, its inhabitants will soon forge ahead of
India. Years of meditation convinced Buddha of the
lasting evils of such a system, and he therefore expunged
it—another instance of the difference existing between
the influence on matters temporal exerted by both these
great religions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In order to gauge with any accuracy the general
effects of Buddha’s doctrines in controlling such
propensities to evil as his devotees may have possessed,
some knowledge of their condition before the promulgation
of such teachings would be indispensable; and
I am further prevented from forming a judgment in the
matter by the fact that my ignorance of their language,
at the period of which I am writing, afforded me but
scant opportunity of mixing with the inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, we were then virtually at war with them.
We had, it is true, fulminated a “Proclamation,” annexing
the country up to a certain point; but, <i>ipso facto</i>,
beyond a few places along the river, we could not call
an inch of territory our own. A guerilla warfare was
maintained for some time, accompanied by reprisals and
cruelties common to fighting in all countries and ages,
no matter whether the combatants are barbarians or
civilized. On the whole, however, I hardly think the
Burmese displayed any special aptitude for inflicting
torture, although a general idea somehow obtained
currency that they were <i>facile princeps</i> in this respect.
Most assuredly they never tarnished their nationality
with such hideous and indelible stains as the natives
of India brought on themselves during the whole
ghastly course of the Mutiny, by unparalleled atrocities
that sent a shudder through every land, branding
them with infamy throughout all time. What more
natural than that the Burmese, knowing from bitter
experience their own inability to cope with us in the
open field, and occupying every coign of vantage in
their jungle fastnesses, should pounce down upon us
when least expected?
</p>

<p>
We received more than one salutary lesson in this
wise, and had to retreat under difficulties, often with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
loss; nevertheless, though the enemy were smarting
under frequent repulses, no after acts of wanton cruelty
could be brought home to them, such as are but too
common when the civilized nations of Europe fly at
each other’s throats, mowing down human life as if it
merely represented so many fields of standing corn ripe
for the harvest.
</p>

<p>
Irrespective, then, of its many glaring faults, there
cannot exist a shadow of a doubt as to the beneficial
influence which Buddhism exercises over its votaries
in many ways, and we can scarcely feel surprise that
these should number nearly one-third of the human
race.
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of metempsychosis, if it taught them
nothing else, brought home to them a widespread
respect for life in all its forms: they evinced considerable
reluctance to subjecting a certain human parasite
to the microscope for fear of injuring it; they would not
beat a dog that had offended, because of some fancied
resemblance between its bark and the voice of a departed
friend. Absurd such extremes, no doubt, yet fraught
with signal benefit to Buddhists in general, far more so
indeed than any opposite condition.
</p>

<p>
Another very conspicuous feature in their daily life
was the unselfishness inculcated by their religion. In
India the representatives of the “lords of creation,” both
Hindu and Mohammedan, were exacting to a degree,
first satisfying their own hunger, and then allowing
wife and children to regale themselves with the “residue
of the remainder,” the former being generally chastised,
often killed, if the food were not prepared exactly
to her lord’s liking, or ready the moment he returned
home. Among the Burmese, however, father,
mother, and children would share alike; and even if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
only one cigar were forthcoming, it would be passed
round for every member of the family to take a few
whiffs.
</p>

<p>
The moral code of Hinduism was at a far lower level
than that of the other religion.
</p>

<p>
Almsgiving, to priests in the absence of beggars, was
much more general in Burmah. As in every community,
and under every form of religion, there were
the good, bad, and indifferent. They were more unanimously
guided by one light than any other nation
I ever knew, and their religion, for all its exaggerated
asceticism, partook more of the practical than that of
many a professed Christian.
</p>

<p>
They could, it is true, boast a number of past-masters
in the gentle art of appropriating other folks’ goods, yet
during the whole of my stay in their country I never
lost a single article, though many of the dwellings in
which I resided had not even a single door! Scarcely,
however, had I returned to India when I missed a bag
of rupees and my watch and chain. Other crimes <i>were</i>
equally uncommon among them. I think my position
enabled me to judge of this; and I cannot recall a
single instance of necessity for <i>post-mortem</i> on a victim
of violence or poison; whereas in India not a day passed
without one, and their multiplicity rendered life a burden.
Corpses, masses of corruption that had run the gauntlet
of a hundred miles of hot sun, were brought at all times
to one’s private dwelling—one met them on the road—everywhere!
</p>

<p>
Nothing appeared to give such exquisite delight to
some of our civil authorities as having plenty of dead
bodies brought forth from every nook and corner to be
examined and reported on, and if dead bodies were
by some rare <i>mischance</i> not forthcoming, they would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
exhume a few bones, which were then decently shunted
from pillar to post as evidence of a murder some score
of years old!
</p>

<p>
This absence of outrage, agrarian or otherwise, speaks
trumpet-tongued for the morality of the Burmese, their
respect for religious observance, and the teachings of
their priests. Such wholesale acts of murder as
Thuggee and infanticide found no place in their ethics;
nor does the senseless practice of Suttee seem ever to
have occurred to them.
</p>

<p>
In many respects, therefore, the teachings of Buddha
transcend Hinduism in no measured degree, being both
more elevated and more practical, exalting instead of
debasing the minds of those who profess them. So
ingrained had become those evil practices in India
that it took years of most stringent legislation to
grapple with the hydra-headed monsters, Heredity
and Fanaticism. Now, however, bands of organized
Thugs are almost unknown; a Suttee will only occur
rarely in some remote district, and infanticide will soon
be a matter of history and tradition.
</p>

<p>
There are, however, Buddhists and Buddhists. Of all
the nations embracing this religion the Chinese and
Nepaulese seem most unmindful of its teachings, whilst
in Thibet and Burmah the flame burned brighter than
elsewhere. The Nepaulese, as I saw them for months
together during the Mutiny—I allude to the men sent
down by Jung Bahadur when the Mutiny was at its
height—were a set of bloodthirsty savages, pig-headed
and untrustworthy, brave indeed, as a pariah-dog might
be when driven into a corner—a rabble which but for
the energy and judgment of the English officers in
command would at once have dissolved into thin air.
They were quite free from any kind of principle, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
had no idea of true religion; while the Bhootanese
were if anything still lower in the scale.
</p>

<p>
Buddha enjoined on his followers to avoid abusive
and indecent language, to become peace-makers, to
endure privation, and show resignation in the face of
calamity. Underlying the Burmese character, one could,
as a rule, trace the influence of these teachings in their
treatment of one another, more than in many a country
professing a religion that points to a happier future. If
faith and good works, irrespective of the medium, are
capable of earning peace and happiness hereafter, then
do the disciples of the “Contemplative One,” who
thought out and purified their religion, enjoy a brighter
prospect than most other nations.
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of “Complete Nirvana” is, to our belief,
the fatal blot, but it is at least preferable to the hereafter
of the Mohammedan, where, under the auspices
of a Supreme Being, the carnal appetites are only
intensified.
</p>

<p>
The absence of that deadliest of all poisons, fanaticism,
and the broad, modest respect which refuses to brand
as heretical and damnable every other form of belief,
also combine to lend a charm to Buddhism which one
seeks in vain in many other religions; and the moral
precepts scattered promiscuously throughout the
Koran, and admirable so far as they go, are terribly
neutralized by an unforgiving and intolerant spirit, that
is ever breathing forth enmity in place of concord.
</p>

<p>
It is my belief that our missionaries will meet with
greater success in the fair land watered by the Irrawaddy
than along the banks of the mighty Ganges, where a
century’s labour has made but little lasting impression.
</p>

<p>
Nor is the failure surprising, when we consider our
want of uniformity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Tabernacle of the Old Testament, appealing to
the senses rather than to the intellect, made but little
impression on the surrounding Gentiles, who proved far
more susceptible to the simplicity inculcated in the
New. And what wonder that the Asiatic sees nought
but chaos in our Church, when we ourselves hear each
clergyman interpreting the rubric according to his own
views! When all are at loggerheads in ecclesiastical
litigation, every variety of Church—high, low, broad,
narrow, deep, shallow—which the mind of man can
conceive, how is the missionary to succeed?

CHAPTER VII.
<br />
RIVER-LIFE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“How many perils do enfold</p>
<p>The righteous man to make him daily fall.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
I once had the temerity to volunteer my valuable
services for an expedition which was fitting out for the
purpose of reducing a rebel stronghold; and the answer
to my application informed me in somewhat laconic
terms that “due information would be given when they
were required.”
</p>

<p>
This was a trifle rude; but I had long since sacrificed
my independence, and had to grin and bear it. Very
shortly afterwards, however, they <i>were</i> wanted; and
I was ordered to proceed without delay to Pegu, where
I was to take charge of the garrison. The summons
was accompanied by the pleasing intelligence that the
river was infested with gangs of dacoits; and indeed
the kindly warnings and exhortations to extreme
wariness and energy were tantamount to an assurance
that, if I fell into the hands of the enemy, my head
would in all probability be sent to Ava as a trophy.
Provided, however, that it were permitted to retain the
position assigned to it by nature, I was to report myself
at Pegu in the shortest possible time.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning I was sauntering along the
muddy banks of the river in quest of a suitable conveyance;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
nor had I much difficulty in finding what I
wanted, for, among their many accomplishments, the
Burmese are very fair boat-builders, their craft, if not
very ornamental, being at least large and roomy, with
plenty of beam, and provided with thatched roofs as a
protection against the fierce rays of a tropical sun. I
soon concluded arrangements for one provided with
sails as well as oars, and manned by a crew of four
rowers and a steersman. Just as I had struck a very
satisfactory bargain, I was saluted by a Madras native
officer in command of four sepoys, who also had to
join their regiment quartered at Pegu. They carried
muskets and a goodly supply of ammunition; and I
therefore thought fit to propose that they should accompany
me, convinced that they would help me give a
good account of any Burmese war-boats that might
venture to molest us.
</p>

<p>
The offer was eagerly accepted; and I had every
reason to be satisfied with my companion, who proved
a very intelligent fellow, and was fortunately sufficiently
master of the English language to enable me to dispense
with that painful medley of distorted English, mongrel
Hindustani and original Burmese by which I was in
those days compelled to give expression to my thoughts
when conversing with Asiatics.
</p>

<p>
It was customary at the time of which I am writing—and,
for all I know to the contrary, may be so still—for
the Bengalese to look down upon the Madras soldiers
as a vastly inferior set of men, and especially to ridicule
their helmets and general attire. Physically inferior
they were without a doubt; but there was much in the
way of compensation, notably their freedom from the
unnatural trammels of caste; they were also more
sociable, readily joining their officers in cricket and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
other games, and far more eager to acquire information.
</p>

<p>
The Bengal sepoy, on the other hand, was better set
up and more imposing-looking, and there his qualifications
ended: drill and other duties over, he became a
somewhat sensual recluse, with no thought for anything
save eating and drinking, and weighed down with sheer
grief if he infringed the rigid line laid down by his own
sect.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the ordinary and unvarying routine of everyday
life, his mind was a blank; and it was no easy
matter to avoid the mere shadow of offence with men so
ready to impute their own sinister designs to others.
Subterfuge and cunning occupied the place of intelligence;
and when the veil was at last thrown aside, they
appeared in their true character, repulsive and forbidding.
Even then we were slow to believe it; and
officers pinned their faith in their integrity, until the
men turned round and shot them down without compunction.
</p>

<p>
The sun was well up, too much so indeed to be
exactly pleasant, when we stood by the boat next
morning impatient to be off; but our eagerness was to
all appearances not shared by the Burmese, who seemed
to have lost their heads, their courage oozing away as
the time for departure approached, assailed no doubt by
visions of decapitation, which would assuredly be their
lot if captured in the act of conveying the enemy.
</p>

<p>
We were twelve, all told: under the thatch, which
covered the middle of the boat, sat the native officer
and myself, the sepoys and my servant; the steersman
squatted on a raised platform astern, and the rowers sat
for’ard.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned my servant, and must devote a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
words to so important a personage. This admirable
Bengalee, who <i>out of his own country</i> was bearer, cook,
waiter, cleaner and tailor all rolled into one, seldom or
never gave me occasion to find fault with him, either
during the two years he remained in my service in
Burmah, or when he afterwards rejoined me on my
return to Bengal.
</p>

<p>
But perfection is no plant of earthly growth, and the
poor fellow had one great drawback, certainly no fault of
his own, and that was intense ugliness. So repellent
indeed was he, that he absolutely struck terror to the
hearts of certain charming young ladies at a large
up-country station where there was much dining out.
He was of abnormal height, and of unusually dark
complexion; from his long, gaunt face shone very
prominent, staring eyes; and he had a silent yet
determined way of moving about, as if his master were
the only person of consequence present, and ought to be
attended to first.
</p>

<p>
I, of course, was quite used to his unprepossessing
appearance and singular ways; not so the others, and
I was eventually requested to discontinue bringing him
as my table attendant.
</p>

<p>
The tide of public opinion ran so strong against him,
that I very reluctantly had to send this excellent factotum
away, though I felt thoroughly ashamed of my
weakness in yielding to the braying of <i>vox populi</i>, dictated
as a rule by some ignorant prejudice and not by
a proper sense of the fitness of things.
</p>

<p>
The boat at length got under weigh, the mainsail was
hoisted, and we made for the mouth of the river, at
which point it divides into two branches, the Irrawaddy
proper and the Pegu branch.
</p>

<p>
Here occurred disaster number one, a sudden and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
violent gust blowing us high and dry on a sandbank.
It was impossible to move the heavy boat with so few
hands, so we called to our aid all the patience in our
virtuous natures and waited amid howling wind and
drenching rain, until the rising tide once more set us
afloat.
</p>

<p>
We had not proceeded far on our way up the river
before the sun gave signs of setting, and darkness was
upon us. I left to the Burmese the solution of the
difficulty that now presented itself, viz. where to lay to
for the night, and they soon entered a creek covered in
by thick foliage, which indeed, besides almost concealing
the entrance, completely shut out the sky. But it
contained an enemy not provided for in my despatches:
the mosquitoes, evidently enraged at our
unwarrantable intrusion, came forth in myriads, filling
the air around with their hideous buzzing.
</p>

<p>
Nature and habit enabled the pachydermatous sepoys
and aborigines to treat the onslaught with indifference;
but my own irritation became ere long unbearable,
and I ordered the boat into midstream, where we
anchored for the night midway between two vast
forests.
</p>

<p>
In one other place only, and that the notorious Panglang
creek, have I experienced any approach to these in
number and ferocity.
</p>

<p>
Their furious attack even disturbed my rest, provided
though I was with curtains; while the sufferings of over
a hundred European soldiers, ranged along the lower
deck of our cargo boat, were displayed next morning in
unequivocal signs. The language used throughout that
trying night was more forcible than polite, though considerably
more justified than the foul language one constantly
hears at home from a certain class of people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
whom a heredity, as strong as that of drink or gout, has
taught to embellish every sentence of their conversation
with irrelevant oaths.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion I believe even the “Contemplative
One” would have indulged in expressive language, at
the risk of having to undergo a few more transmigrations,
extending perhaps over a trifling billion of years.
</p>

<p>
Besides being free from the attacks of the mosquitoes,
of which only a few stragglers continued to harass us,
it was far more pleasant away from the trees, which
shut out the little breeze there was; and, to my way of
thinking at least, much safer, as the Burmese are
adepts at stealing noiselessly through their own jungles,
and we might have easily been boarded and cut down
in cold blood.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the anchor held, and the boat pointed
bow up stream, the all-important process of cooking
commenced, and I was soon served with a curried fowl,
an omelette, and a bottle of beer. The natives of
Eastern lands can cook as no other race knows how;
their curries and omelettes are unequalled at any restaurant
in Paris, and they will improvise a kitchen of
the simplest materials and under the most trying
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
In camp, under the leafy canopy of a mango tree,
I have often sat down to a dinner consisting of soup,
fish, entrées, joints, game and pastry, all served <i>secundum
artem</i>.
</p>

<p>
Things are sadly otherwise at home; if the kitchen
range gets temporarily out of order—a very common
occurrence—the cook becomes as irritable as a bear
with a sore head, and even the simplest substitute for
a meal is served to the accompaniment of <i>parliamentary</i>
language.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Dinner over, I retired with my pipe to the stern to
ruminate. After the excitement of the day came the
inevitable reaction, and I certainly felt to all intents and
purposes alone in the world.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto I had belonged to a comfortable mess,
enjoying plenty of company and diversion, and surrounded
by all the pomp and circumstance of war;
now I was on an unexplored river, with unknown
dangers at every turn. Amid these novel surroundings
my thoughts naturally took a wide range, annihilating
distance and dwelling upon the old, familiar faces at
home. Anon the roar of a wild beast would recall me
to my present position; and in one of the painful
silences that followed—the <i>animals</i> in the boat had
fed and were now buried in happy oblivion—I felt sure
that another boat, much larger than our own, was
rapidly approaching. To make assurance doubly sure,
I dipped the blade of a paddle under water, and with
the handle to my ear, distinctly heard the enemy advancing
and already close at hand. As it was now
past eleven, they had evidently calculated on finding us
all asleep, and only with the utmost expedition did I
succeed in arousing the guard in time.
</p>

<p>
By the time our arms were in readiness they were
upon us: and, covering the gentleman at the helm, I
informed him politely in his own language that any
further advance on the part of his friends would
compel me to deprive them of his own valuable
services.
</p>

<p>
An ominous silence on their part convinced me that
they were determined to board us, and indeed though
my instructions concerning the prompt use of cartridge
and bayonet would have made a considerable gap in
their boat, the odds would still have been fearfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
against us. This trial of strength was, however not to
be; the boat steadily fell back, and the rapid current
soon carried it out of sight.
</p>

<p>
We now breathed more freely, though some acquaintance
with the native manner of conducting warfare
caused me to station sentries fore and aft. For a time,
our imagination supplied all manner of strange sounds,
and at about one the native officer begged me to lie down
and rest, promising that he and his men would be on the
<i>qui vive</i>, and arouse me if necessary. I was at first
reluctant to follow his advice, as the idea of having my
throat cut while asleep and waking up a dead man, as
the Irishman said, was not a pleasant one; and it was
really out of deference to the officer’s feelings that I
at length assumed the horizontal, fully armed, and
without the least intention of sleeping; for a refusal on
my part would have implied unequivocal distrust of
him and his men.
</p>

<p>
In spite of myself, however, I fell into a sound sleep,
from which I awoke only when the sun was high in the
heavens.
</p>

<p>
The native officer expressed a hope that the sleep
had refreshed me, and then detailed to me all that had
transpired since I had lost consciousness. Shortly after
the commencement of his watch his attention was
attracted by a fire some way up the right bank, round
which a number of natives appeared to be dancing.
</p>

<p>
This was evidently a ruse to put us off the scent; for
no sooner had the embers died out, than the hostile
boat again approached, but, on being challenged, fell
back as before. He had therefore refrained from waking
me, and had evidently kept everything on board as
quiet as possible, that I might not be disturbed by
Burmese exclamations, never notorious for melody. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
was thoughtful to a degree; and I did not fail to report
all circumstances on arrival.
</p>

<p>
The enemy had evidently hoped to steal a march on
us, finding us napping and consequently achieving their
object without risk to their precious selves; strange to
say, their plans were frustrated by so trivial a chance as
my resolve to indulge in another pipe before turning in.
The fire on shore was only an ingenious and favourite
native <i>ruse de guerre</i> intended to restore us to a false
state of security; in the creek we should undoubtedly
have been massacred, so that the mosquitoes, reprobates
though they were, unintentionally did us a good turn.
After somewhat restricted ablutions, performed under
considerable difficulties, and followed by a hearty breakfast,
I resumed my seat in the stern of the boat, and,
under the friendly cover of a large umbrella, proceeded
to inspect the banks past which we slowly glided.
</p>

<p>
On either side stretched a vast forest of trees, festooned
with creepers and thickly populated by various species
of monkeys; the females, with their young clinging to
them, remained in the background, but the males came
out to the ends of the branches that overhung the
water, evidently very angry at our approach, to judge
from the manner in which they grinned and spat at us.
They are timid, nervous creatures wherever met with,
and interesting only when wrought up to a high pitch
of anger, in which state they are charming and more
engaging indeed than any other animal.
</p>

<p>
I was on one occasion called in to attend one that a
friend had made hopelessly drunk. It was a somewhat
cruel joke, but not without its ludicrous aspect. I put
my patient to bed, where with its head on the pillow
he looked painfully human. Next morning I found
him awake, lying quite still; and in reply to my inquiry,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
which I made from sheer force of habit, he raised
one hand to his head; and, out of regard for his general
resemblance to my own species, I prescribed a brandy
and soda, which actually had the desired effect.
</p>

<p>
Now and again a splash ahead would reveal an
alligator finding it in his discretion safer at the
bottom—such fear does man inspire among created
things, many of which, could they but know their own
strength, would soon lower his pride.
</p>

<p>
Birds possessed of gaudy plumage and discordant
voices were very plentiful: there was the kingfisher
perched on an overhanging bough with one eye on the
water and his head on one side; and the burnished fly-catcher
darted to and fro in search of food.
</p>

<p>
My observations were rudely interrupted by a puff
of smoke from the jungle, followed by another and
another.
</p>

<p>
We were in fact being made a target of, which was
the more awkward that the river narrowed considerably
at this point from the fact of its flowing through a
range of low hills.
</p>

<p>
These efforts, whether made by our friends of the
previous night or by an independent party, were unsuccessful,
though a kind of bullet did now and then
bury itself in the thatch of the boat; we decided that
to return their fire would be an imprudent waste of
ammunition, as the party doubtless shifted their position
after firing each shot.
</p>

<p>
We therefore steered straight up the centre of the
river; and as some safeguard against treachery I held
my revolver close to the steersman’s head, and placed
two sepoys with loaded muskets over the rowers, with
instructions to shoot any one who attempted to jump
overboard.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Proceeding in silence, interrupted only by the faint
report of firearms from the bank, we soon reached a
broader part of the river, where we once more anchored
in midstream, and I instituted regular sentry duty, as
the enemy were still unflagging in their attentions.
</p>

<p>
The persevering way in which they hovered about us
pointed to some special reason; at one time I fancied
“loot” was the object, and that, seeing soldiers on
board, they had come to the conclusion that we must be
escorting bags of rupees wherewith to pay the troops
occupying Pegu. Or perhaps they thought that a
single European, proceeding with a guard up country,
must be some important personage worth a heavy
ransom; even killing such an official might in some way
benefit their cause, besides leading to some substantial
reward.
</p>

<p>
In the immediate neighbourhood of Pegu I do not
remember a single flag or pagoda, and certainly no
trace of a village.
</p>

<p>
Birds, reptiles, and similar creatures seemed to be in
undisputed possession; and as the mail-boats were
seldom molested, and commissariat stores usually arrived
intact, I suppose the authorities thought any
periodical patrolling of the Pegu river quite unnecessary.
On my report, however, an armed boat was sent
down, but without encountering any marauding party,
so the affair was allowed to blow over. Towards the
evening of the next day we reached our destination, and
were one and all heartily glad of it.
</p>

<p>
The prospect was nevertheless far from inviting.
With the exception of a span of raised road, and a very
inadequate apology for a town, the whole country side
resembled an endless waste of water, broken only by
patches of trees and shrubs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The road, which was about a mile long, terminated
at the foot of a flight of steps that led up to a large
pagoda, on the terrace of which, some thirty feet above
the surrounding level, the troops were located, and
would have to remain during the remaining few months
until the monsoon was at an end.
</p>

<p>
There was, at any rate, no immediate fear that lack
of water would be included in the many straits to which
we might ere long be put.
</p>

<p>
Ascending the steps—and they were legion, giving
me a far better idea of infinity than any professor of
mathematics had ever succeeded in demonstrating—I
found myself on a level platform extending all round
the pagoda proper, at the edge of which stood the
European and native barracks, that accommodated the
detachments from various regiments of which the
garrison was composed.
</p>

<p>
There were samples from Bengal and Madras, including
some of the 1st Madras Fusiliers, the finest
men I ever set eyes on. Cabin’d, cribbed, confined
as they were in this limited space, all looked well, contented,
even happy, though I was at a loss to imagine
how they managed to pass such long days with so few
duties to perform, and such slender resources, in the
way of books and other amusements, at their command.
The secret of their health lay, without doubt, in their
being unable to obtain more than the authorized allowance
of “grog.”
</p>

<p>
Some there were too who, a few years later, took an
active part in suppressing the Mutiny, being especially
conspicuous in the operations that centred around the
theatre of the most important engagements of the
whole movement, Benares and Lucknow. I need not
dwell on their exploits, for they are written in imperishable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
letters throughout the chronicles of that
mighty upheaval. My intercourse with them was
marred by one unfortunate and unlooked-for circumstance,
over which I prefer to draw a veil, for the
person concerned succumbed after performing miracles
of valour; and then and ever since I regretted my
inability to be near him before it was too late.
</p>

<p>
After having reported my arrival, and mentioned our
adventures <i>en route</i>, I was conducted to the abode I
was to occupy, nothing more or less than a huge <i>pon-gyee</i>
house, large enough to accommodate half a dozen. It
was constructed of teak, supported by massive pillars, and
substantially roofed; moreover, it was open at the back,
where it abutted on the pagoda, and innocent of doors.
</p>

<p>
The flooring, composed of split bamboo, was rather
more than two feet from the ground, and was covered
with mats of the same material.
</p>

<p>
But for this raised flooring I should, when the floodgates
of the upper regions opened upon us, most probably
have lost all my available furniture, which, though
scarcely worth insuring, certainly sufficed for my modest
requirements, comprising, as it did, a camp bed, table,
and chair; two bullock trunks, a brass washing basin
and stand, and a strip of carpet.
</p>

<p>
My new lodging was not by any means as snug as
my old quarters in the Rangoon stockade; nor was my
“factotum” slow to perceive the difference, though
with that practical common sense that went so far to
atone for his afore-mentioned ugliness, he at once set to
work to make matters as straight as possible. In the
first place he swept the place out, above and below, the
vigorous application of a <i>vis a tergo</i>, in the shape of a
birch, giving sundry frogs and scorpions summary
notice to quit their old homes on the ground-floor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then, having next dislodged from the interstices of
the upper storey a vast accumulation of dust, ants, and
spiders, he arranged my furniture as his own judgment
approved. Most of all I missed the verandah, to which
I had always been accustomed, a place where, in sunshine
or rain, one could always obtain some sort of
exercise and enjoy the beauties of nature. Here they
were all hidden from view, though I could hardly
bemoan the want of ventilation, since the wind searched
out every nook and cranny of the house, blowing at
times so hard as to create no little difficulty in the
matter of keeping one’s lamps alight.
</p>

<p>
A breeze was, however, generally more welcome
than not, for the direct rays of the sun, and reflected
heat from the pagoda, induced a temperature very trying
to Europeans in general, new arrivals in particular.
A hot mist, the result of evaporation of the surrounding
water, stretched as far as the eye could reach in every
direction. The average rainfall during the monsoon
was, as far as I remember, some 120 inches; and whenever
Jupiter Pluvius checked the flood, the clouds
would roll away, the sun shine forth in all his might,
and even the crows would pant in comparative silence.
</p>

<p>
As the sights of the place could be disposed of in a
quarter of an hour, consisting of barracks above and
water below, and as it was moreover impossible to
move a step beyond the terrace, life soon narrowed
down to the routine of daily duties, occupying the early
morning and evening, and leaving the day to be disposed
of with such resources as individuals possessed in
themselves. To those destitute of such, life must have
been as slow as a twice-told tale; day after day, week
after week, month after month, the same ordeal, the
same familiar faces, identical surroundings, and nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
to do; everyone glad when the rain fell, equally pleased
when the sun shone; anxious to rise, still more so to go
to bed. Yet in spite of this almost intolerable “<i>nuy</i>”—as
I once heard a soldier pronounce it—I never had
charge of a healthier garrison. They were, it is true,
cut off <i>in toto</i> from all sources of dissipation; but, even
allowing for this, I was unable to account for the unusual
immunity from illness, the more so that even
among the native population it was equally noticeable.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, a few cases of snake-bites and fever, as well
as an occasional accident, yielded all the professional
work which fell to my lot; I felt, in fact, almost
ashamed to accept my pay, but it was so generously
pressed upon me every month by the paymaster that I
had not the courage to refuse it for fear of giving
offence; and my conscience was, after all, somewhat
quieted by the recollection of all I had to endure in the
shape of climatic hardship and personal inconvenience
from every kind of tormentor, insect and reptile, which
in this place converged to a focus. Crows and kites
found it a most agreeable <i>rendezvous</i>; they swarmed
around from “rosy morn to dewy eve,” the former
eternally jabbering and quarrelling over the remains
of defunct animal life and the <i>débris</i> of many a repast.
</p>

<p>
Impudent, arrant thieves as they were, not unfrequently
advancing boldly inside the barracks and other
dwellings, we should have suffered without such admirable
scavengers, insatiable, and endowed with singular
intelligence, cunning, and general aptitude for
the position assigned to them by nature.
</p>

<p>
Pariah-dogs would also steal into the place by some
mysterious path, also useful scavengers, but rewarded, I
fear, with more kicks than caresses.
</p>

<p>
In Burmah, as in India, they are only half domesticated,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
showing the same aptitude for education as
elsewhere. They are as omnivorous as the jackal;
nothing comes amiss to them, animal or vegetable,
dead or alive. The jackal is, if I remember aright,
not met with on the Burmah side of the Arracan hills.
It may be the country is distasteful to them from the
luxuriance of its vegetation; anyhow, their absence is
a blessing to mankind, were it only on account of the
manner in which they make night hideous with their
weird cries, to say nothing of their predatory proclivities
and offensive smell.
</p>

<p>
Another matter of vital importance to all desirous of
enjoying a good night’s rest—upon which more depends
in the tropics, where the excessive heat so thoroughly
exhausts the whole system, than at home—was, as I
soon had occasion to learn, constant attention to the
entirety of one’s mosquito-curtains, ever so small a hole
being fatal to one’s repose.
</p>

<p>
These blood-sucking savages were greatly in evidence
at Pegu—as where in the East are they not?—and of a
fine, vigorous breed, gifted with healthy appetites, and
evincing a decided preference for white flesh, wherein
they resemble their pelagic prototype, the shark.
</p>

<p>
Most to be dreaded was the speckled variety, which,
besides being more active and persevering, buzzed more
loudly, and secreted a more irritating poison; a brace
of them under the same canopy were not to be brought
to book except after a long and tedious chase, involving
a deal of tongue-banging and the employment of expressive
adjectives, for which it is to be hoped every
allowance will be made here and hereafter.
</p>

<p>
Whatever purpose the mosquito may have been intended
to serve in nature’s economy, other than that of
tormentor-in-chief to mankind, has not yet been revealed;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
but for this post at least no one can deny its
especial aptitude.
</p>

<p>
In spite of a prevalent idea to the contrary, it would
indeed be difficult to exaggerate the discomforts of
living in the East, even under favourable conditions;
but when the adjuncts essential to even comparative
comfort are from force of circumstances unobtainable,
existence is more easily imagined than described. And
those people give a very loose rein to their imagination
who are wont to include a carriage and punkah in the
category of luxuries: as well might an Anglo-Indian
condemn the effeminacy of using fires and warm clothing
during a severe winter in England.
</p>

<p>
Self-denial is a virtue that should be practised
wherever occasion offers, but it is far easier to do so at
home than abroad. Those that have never visited our
Eastern possessions are too fond of decrying the luxuries
of the Europeans that reside there; and this readiness
to throw stones at their less fortunate brothers and
sisters is particularly out of place in a nation so notoriously
luxurious and extravagant, that it eats, I
really believe, more than any other in Europe, and
annually drinks sufficient to float the allied fleets of the
world!
</p>

<p>
In the Pegu garrison, whatever our hereditary national
tendencies might be, we could only procure what
the gods, or rather the commissariat, sent us; and not
the veriest ascetic could have lamented either the
abundance, variety, or quality of our fare.
</p>

<p>
For the four months during which I was cooped up
there the daily ration consisted of 1 lb. meat (including
bone!), 1 lb. bread (including sand!), some tea, sugar,
and salt, and a wineglassful of rum—the whole costing
Rs. 15 <i>per mensem</i>, or one shilling a day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The beef was doubtless furnished by buffaloes that
had rendered many years’ hard work to their rightful
owners; the bread would have been tolerable, had it
not been so gritty as to wear away one’s teeth: the
Commissariat Sergeant was one day very gratified by
my complimenting him on the excellence of his bread,
but his countenance fell many degrees when I begged
that he would serve me the sandy part of it separately,
so that I might add, as they say in the cookery book,
“according to taste.”
</p>

<p>
But there was from this time forth a marked improvement
in the bread; and the other articles were
not bad, though I had certainly tasted better tea, and
had doubtless used sugar that left less residue at the
bottom of the cup.
</p>

<p>
The condition of the surrounding country rendered
it next to impossible to tap its resources, and our
individual attempts to procure fowls and eggs met with
no success whatever. The aforementioned commodities
had accordingly to do duty for a considerable period;
and it was during the trying time when necessity compelled
us to make the best of them, that I especially
regretted never having dived into the art and mystery
of cooking, which I regard as conducing more than any
other to length of years, domestic happiness, and a
steady, unruffled stream of good temper and forbearance
with everything and everybody. My “factotum”
certainly did his best, but that did not include miracles.
</p>

<p>
Beef alone admitted only of being roast or boiled,
and the changes were accordingly rung on these economical
methods of cooking. To rum in any shape I was
never very partial, although, when good and indulged
in judiciously, I believe it to be a most wholesome
beverage. Made into punch with various adjuncts, it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
may commend itself; but the only one procurable here
was water, largely impregnated with organic matter.
All who neglected to boil and filter it incurred a
very troublesome form of ringworm, which broke out all
over the body, especially on the thighs and abdomen.
</p>

<p>
That troublesome worm the “Dracunculus” was also
very common, and I should not like to venture on a
statement of how many dozens of yards of them I have
wound round various substances.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the rains, an appalling case of
that singular disease Beri-beri occurred in a Madras
Sepoy, though I cannot say whether the water was in
this instance to blame.
</p>

<p>
I swallowed the daily allowance of rum religiously as
a corrective to the water, generally reserving it for the
post-prandial pipe, a combination that assisted the
mind’s eye in viewing matters in general through a
roseate lens.
</p>

<p>
On very damp nights, when the rain was still coming
down in its might, I found it salutary to keep a large
wood fire burning on an uncovered spot at the other end
of my residence; the smoke drove away insects, the heat
dried the saturated atmosphere and damp clothes,
while the flames brightened the gloomy surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Over this conflagration I would silently smoke my
pipe and husband my meagre allowance of rum and
water, and this was frequently the most pleasant hour
of the twenty-four, as, keeping well to windward,
neither flames nor smoke incommoded me in the
least.
</p>

<p>
Among the many insect pests, whose view of the
beauties of the fire differed in all probability from my
own, were those extremely disgusting creatures, yclept
“Flying Bugs,” which are of a greenish colour, about the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
size of a lady-bird; and which, on the slightest provocation,
emit their horrible effluvia. They come forth of
an evening only: the musk rat is bad enough, and to
be avoided; the Flying Bug is ten times worse, and to
be dreaded!
</p>

<p>
To keep these visitors at bay, my “factotum” used
to hold a large umbrella over me at meals; many of
them would nevertheless alight on my tablecloth and
would even occasionally invade my plate; nay, I even
remember a specimen between my teeth, and shall
never forget the fœtid taste or the sickness that
resulted.
</p>

<p>
Not fifty yards from my abode were the barracks of
the 1st Madras Fusiliers. One night, as the sentry was
pacing up and down, an animal suddenly sprang over
the low parapet close to him; it was a tiger, and on
his coming to the charge, it disappeared as suddenly
as it had come. They had been reported prowling
around the cattle, for the rains were nearly over, and dry
land was beginning to appear.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance caused a sensation at the time, and
became a nine days’ wonder in the garrison, after which
it was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Some little time afterwards I awoke in the night—a
very unusual proceeding on my part—and beheld two
great, fiery eyes glaring at me out of the darkness, and
apparently belonging to something within a few
feet of my mosquito curtains. In an instant the idea
flashed on me that this was <i>the</i> tiger, and terror so
prostrated me, that I could only lie still, scarcely daring
to breathe, turning hot and cold, and looking in a
fascinated helplessness straight into those cruel orbs,
while I marvelled even in my agony at their changing
colours.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It occurred to me that the mosquito curtains were
bothering him; otherwise, why should he keep staring
at me thus?
</p>

<p>
A thousand things flashed through my brain, and the
events of my young life marshalled themselves before
me in rapid succession. Perhaps my thoughts, varied
as they were, did not take many seconds of time, but to
me it appeared an eternity: and yet the tiger never
moved!
</p>

<p>
At last the suspense became intolerable; and, having
at length resolved to end it one way or the other, I
stealthily grasped my sword, and with sudden energy
drove it into the curtain and into a soft body, which
disappeared with a fearful yell—a pariah-dog! He and
his companions had to their advantage discovered the
whereabouts of my food, and it was the sound of the lid
falling back on the now empty chest that had awakened
me; and to this day I never could conjecture why one
of the troop preferred watching me in that way and
giving me such a fright.
</p>

<p>
Henceforth I bore the race no very friendly feeling,
and lost no opportunity of retaliating.
</p>

<p>
To keep them clear of my sacred precincts, I employed
a native bow of peculiar construction, termed a
“Golail” and bullets of well-baked clay; and I soon
became a sufficiently accurate shot to convince them
of the desirability of giving my quarters a wide
berth.
</p>

<p>
I carefully replaced the lid on the empty provision
chest, without telling my “factotum” a word of the
night’s events; but on calling for breakfast, fully aware
that not a crumb had escaped the burglary, I watched
his face narrowly and was glad!
</p>

<p>
Utter bewilderment, fright, anger and despair were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
all portrayed there; he managed to brew some tea, and
I had to be satisfied with that and a pipe—fortunately
my tobacco had been stowed away elsewhere, otherwise
I verily believe that they would have eaten that as well,
and probably felt none the worse for it!
</p>

<p>
As the waters receded, native dwellings sprang up
around as if by magic, and Burmese came from—goodness
knows where! They divined our wants, and, like
every other nation on the face of the globe, were not
averse to supplying them at a good profit. Hitherto,
my expenditure had figured at the modest amount of
Rs. 25 a month, 15 for rations and 10 for my servant,
while the balance was accumulating. Two pound ten
shillings was not excessive for a month’s living and
attendance, while quarters were free.
</p>

<p>
A new arrival brought to the station some beer and
other delicacies, and the morning after I had dined
with him, I awoke a wiser and a better man, for, truth
to tell, the sameness of diet was beginning to tell on all
of us: man may not require a variety of stimulants,
but the stimulus of variety is at all times essential to
his well-being.
</p>

<p>
We were also able to extend our sphere of exercise;
at first along the main and only road to the river; and
then, with extreme caution, in other directions.
</p>

<p>
This was an intense relief after having been cooped
up so many months in such limited quarters; indeed
we were in some respects worse off than Noah and his
family when they left the ark.
</p>

<p>
But though there was no miraculous intervention in
our behalf, we were wonderfully protected from native
hostility from without; what would have told fearfully
against us was an epidemic of any sort, such as cholera,
dysentery or typhoid; and that single case of Beri-beri,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
so acute and so rapidly fatal, afforded me great anxiety
for many days afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The sufferer was pitiable to behold; every secretion
of the body was in abeyance, and there was a total
suppression of water and comatose. I was preparing a
dry bath of heated air, by means of very hot bricks that
were to be placed under a chair on which the patient
was to sit, enveloped in blankets. But time was not
afforded to try this, the only plan that occurred to me.
</p>

<p>
When he died, he was unable either to articulate or
swallow; the latter process would in any case have been
of slight use, since there was not a drug in the whole of
the Pharmacopeia that could have saved him.
</p>

<p>
There was indeed a species of “Mudar,” a plant with
succulent leaves, that fringed the wells, and the juice
expressed from it had a very beneficial effect upon
the aforementioned ringworm: the complaint and its
remedy were thus strangely in juxtaposition, one inside
the well and the other outside.
</p>

<p>
Supposing, however, that Beri-beri was induced
through the same channel, one could scarcely expect to
find its antidote there also; and even if it were there, it
would have to be administered at the outset before the
disease had sufficiently declared itself to admit of
diagnosis.
</p>

<p>
In cholera, intermittent and yellow fever, together
with many other diseases of an epidemic and endemic
nature, I have for many years believed that the true
remedy will be found in germicides administered, not
through the digestive functions, but hypodermically
direct into the system, so that its actual contact with
the germs shall insure their destruction, at the cost of
some suffering, maybe not without risk, yet the only
possible remedy. I advocated it in the East in respect
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
of cholera, but in the service one was never free to act,
except under the auspices of a host of inspectors, whose
chief talent lay in the art of dishing up piles of statistics,
sufficiently appalling to confuse any government.
</p>

<p>
Life was beginning to wear a very different aspect,
for we were elated at the approaching prospect of
shooting in the jungles that were teeming with large
and small game; and moreover the weather would
greatly improve in our favour.
</p>

<p>
Alas! certain detachments of European troops were
ordered to the front, and I had to accompany them.
Such is military life, especially during a campaign; and
there was nothing left but to pack up and obey.
</p>

<p>
The men and officers were equally jubilant at the idea
of proceeding to the headquarters of their regiment, and
enjoying the good things that were invariably to be
found there.
</p>

<p>
A new place is moreover always attractive in prospect,
whatever its reality may prove; all fields look green in
the distance, a happy provision for mankind in general.
</p>

<p>
Here, at any rate, was a chance of disturbing the
mental cobwebs which had accumulated during our
enforced isolation, and an opportunity of seeing what
might prove a brighter side of life. All was at once
transformed to bustle and activity; and the boats
inspected and portioned out might be seen a few days
later floating down stream with their living freights.
</p>

<p>
A day or two previous to our departure, an officer,
who had just arrived, asked if he might have my quarters.
He hailed from the Madras Presidency, and proved
a very jolly companion. His bed was placed parallel to
my own, though some little space intervened, an arrangement
that enabled me the better to observe the
habit that had acquired irresistible influence over him—he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
was an inveterate smoker. He invariably affected
Trichinopoly cheroots, things of a gigantic size with
a hollow reed down the middle, a specimen of which I
remembered having indulged in on the Hooghly, when
hard up for tobacco, and I also remembered that the
consumption of this delicate weed had made me so
giddy that I could hardly reach my cabin.
</p>

<p>
Now, amongst this officer’s baggage stood a large
square package, done up in “ganny,” and looking for
all the world like a bale of cotton. He informed me
that this held 10,000 <i>Trichys</i>, “the number I generally
carry about with me, you know!”
</p>

<p>
He smoked all day long, and even at nights there was
an eternal globe of fire glowing through his curtains—he
evidently was not destined to be prematurely
cremated.

<i>Facile est descensus!</i> It was one thing to be pulled
against a strong stream; quite another to have it in our
favour. It was one thing to ascend the river, a solitary
European in the company of many natives, but very
different to be one of a fleet going down with some two
hundred Europeans fully armed, men of training and
renown, who had won many a hard-contested fight in
the face of fearful odds.
</p>

<p>
I do not suppose that any regiment had seen more
active service than the old 1st Bengal Fusiliers, or had
been more instrumental in conquering and defending our
vast Asiatic possessions.
</p>

<p>
In physique they could not on the whole compare
with their brother regiment on the Madras side.
The reason was obvious; the constant gaps occurring
in their well-tried ranks had to be filled by an annual
supply of young recruits, while the Madras contingent
were, from their position, deprived of the opportunities
of seeing such service till the Mutiny broke out, when
they demonstrated unmistakably that their fighting
qualities were only lying dormant, and waiting for an
opportunity to come to the fore.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
</p>

<p>
With either regiment you might go anywhere and
accomplish anything that lay within the power of man;
and, though several decades now lie buried with the
past, I doubt not but they are still the same, only called
by different names.
</p>

<p>
We had approached Pegu under difficulties, creeping
along in a nervous, spasmodic manner, and on the look-out
for unknown dangers at every turn; we left it at
such a pace, that even the monkeys looked askance at
us, all their former anger now changed to sheer amazement.
</p>

<p>
If my memory serves me right, we reached Rangoon
the same evening, and were transferred to a river-steamer
and flat, the latter being a cargo-boat. I beheld the old
stockade, and some of the familiar faces, for the last time.
</p>

<p>
When I next landed there, eighteen months afterwards,
not a vestige remained; the whole place having
been transformed to suit the European style of living.
The only episode that remains to recall this landing to
my mind was, strangely enough, my being introduced
to a European lady. I had long concluded that all
Europeans were of my own sex, so that on the occasion
of this <i>rencontre</i> I was as bashful and tongue-tied as a
youth in love. Since then, when I have been more
constantly thrown into their society, my tongue has
gradually loosened and my blushes have—alas!—grown
imperceptible; but all this has not been accomplished
in a day, nor without a considerable amount of
inward perturbation.
</p>

<p>
This reintroduction to a specimen of the fairer portion
of creation, though of an ephemeral nature, doubtless
had a salutary effect on me; but, however much I may
have desired to improve our acquaintance, inclination
had to succumb to duty, and on the morrow the paddle-wheels
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
were in motion, and the steamer forged ahead,
while the flat, attached by a stout hawser, followed
merrily in its wake.
</p>

<p>
Rangoon gradually faded from view; we were ploughing
the main artery of the Irrawaddy, and our worthy
navigator took a short cut, which may have saved time,
but was in the end far from conducive to the comfort of
the men.
</p>

<p>
Sunset came upon us in a creek notorious for its
elephantine and ravenous mosquitoes, for when that
fiery orb sank in the western sky, the captain had no
choice but to anchor.
</p>

<p>
Navigation of a river required the utmost caution
even by day; by night any attempt in that direction
would have been foolhardy.
</p>

<p>
I have already given a faint idea of the sufferings
endured by the men the whole of that livelong night.
I have already apologized for the tropical temperature
of their language, and I shall not dwell any longer on so
painful an experience.
</p>

<p>
Leaving this place of evil reputation the following
morning, we once more entered the main stream and
pursued the even tenor of our way. Some unusually
large alligators were basking in the sun along the muddy
banks of the river’s many outlets; and so nearly did
their own colour correspond with that of their surroundings,
that it was often impossible to distinguish them,
until, on being awakened by the thud of the paddle-wheels,
they would look up and then crawl or tumble
into the water. Now and again, a rifle was brought to
bear on them; but the bullets would simply glide off
their impenetrable hides, and they crawled leisurely
down to the water as soon as they had had enough of
such amusement.

</p>

<p>
Years afterwards, when floating down a river, I shot
one that was lying asleep on a sandbank. Beyond
once opening its mouth, it never moved; but on landing
and approaching cautiously, we discovered that it
was quite dead. That shot was, in the mysterious
phraseology of sportsmen, a “fluke”!
</p>

<p>
We soon passed the scene of the disaster that had,
only a few months before, caused such a sensation in
Burmah and Calcutta, bringing on the devoted heads
of certain parties one of Lord Dalhousie’s stinging
rebukes.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, this check to our otherwise triumphant
progress occurred in the same place (and under
very similar circumstances) as that of 1825. Mismanagement,
divided authority and imperfect knowledge
of the place and its resources, one and all combined, led
to the failure.
</p>

<p>
The “butcher’s bill” was a heavy one, and our
hospitals at Rangoon were crowded with wounded men.
As I was probing the wound of a soldier who had been
struck in the thigh, there rolled into my hand a gingal
ball the size of a small orange. It was of iron, beaten
into circular form and covered with facets; an ugly
missile, capable of causing a very dangerous, jagged
wound.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for my patient, it had well nigh spent
itself, otherwise it must have shattered the whole thigh.
In another case, a bullet entering the elbow of the right
arm, came out at the left. He was in the act of loading
when hit, and the bullet had travelled the whole way
under the skin, which subsequently mortified, leaving
an extensive surface that was only healed with the
greatest difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Instead, therefore, of viewing the scene from a cargo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
boat, and surviving to delight the reader with these
interesting reflections, my bones might have been
bleaching in that very jungle, for it was actually for
this expedition that my services were declined in an
abrupt manner that has already received recognition in
a previous chapter.
</p>

<p>
Not far above the place with such a chequered military
history, we encountered a boat proceeding down
river with unusual speed, and could only just gather a
bare outline of the news it was conveying—viz. the
assassination of a person holding a high position—when
it continued its course with the same energy as
before.
</p>

<p>
Circumstances of a peculiar nature must have attended
a tragedy of this kind, for, as I have already pointed
out, crimes of such turpitude rarely disfigured the
Burmese character in the days of yore.
</p>

<p>
They were singularly free from the foul breath of
that “green-eyed monster,” jealousy, the mainspring of
two-thirds of the long and appalling list of crimes with
which the natives of India are branded, and furnished
with abundant food for litigation.
</p>

<p>
Climate is no doubt a powerful factor; but this does
not account for such wide differences in the character
of two neighbouring nations, the reason for which must
be sought rather in the degree in which they act up to
the moral code laid down for them by Buddha.
</p>

<p>
On a par with the rest of this teaching, the distance
between the sexes was strained to its utmost extent, an
exaggeration that amounted to absurdity, if not crime,
for to attain “complete Nirvana” a man must not even
look at the opposite sex, not even, in theory, at his own
mother if she were drowning. He might throw her a
log, if at hand, but no more. The ties of matrimony
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
cannot, one would imagine, be very strong among a
nation, of which the men think nothing of staking their
wives and children on a wager, while the wives acquiesce
in it as a perfectly reputable proceeding!
</p>

<p>
The appearance presented by the banks between
which we were now advancing, was by no means as
wild and undisturbed by the hand of man as the Pegu
branch; villages and cultivated patches met the eye
rather frequently, though of so inconsiderable an extent
as to imply that the country was but sparsely populated.
It was up the smaller tributary streams that their
dwellings nestled, beyond the immediate influence of a
river subject to sudden floods. They were built on
piles as an additional security, and even then, communication
could at times only be kept up by means of
boats.
</p>

<p>
Not an agreeable mode of living, according to our
notions, but then the Burmese had never known any
other, and besides, being to all intents and purposes
amphibious, they were endowed by nature with
temperaments of the Mark Tapley order, and consequently
happy under almost any circumstances. Very
weird was the sound of their strange voices, as they
passed us dexterously paddling their canoes, and chanting
one of their barbaric songs.
</p>

<p>
They would stop and look at us as we steamed past,
as would also the women and children peeping from
behind the trees, wondering whether we were really
children of this earth, and doubtless frightened by the
noise of the paddles. Many of them probably recalled
the incidents of the first Burmese war; the manner in
which we fought and the weapons we made use of
accounting for the rapidity with which they yielded all
the important places to an organization well fitted, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
they could see, to carry all before it. Now and then
by carefully planned ambushes in the depths of their
jungles they might score an occasional advantage, but
any open encounter invariably ended in their confusion.
</p>

<p>
Temples, poles bearing all manner of flags, and
images of Gautama, cross-legged and contemplative as
usual, and certainly the reverse of prepossessing, met
the eye wherever villages existed, and in many places
where they did not.
</p>

<p>
Some of the temples and Pon-gyee houses were
exceedingly elegant in their design.
</p>

<p>
Without any remarkable adventure, we arrived one
evening at Prome, where we anchored, without, however,
landing. It was unquestionably situated in the
prettiest part of the river, which here narrowed between
a range of low hills clad in verdure.
</p>

<p>
The Pagoda, some little way inland, stood out in bold
relief on rising ground, while the numerous Pon-gyee
houses, scattered here and there, lent an additional
charm to the scene. As the sun blazed against the
Pagoda next morning, we were off again, having but a
short distance to traverse before forging the last link in
the chain by reporting ourselves at that important
frontier station, Theyetmyo.
</p>

<p>
The reunion of a regiment, that has been for some
time scattered in detachments over a large country,
resembles that of a large family under similar conditions;
and human nature, bad as it may be, undeniably
scored on the credit side in such a meeting. There is
generally no lack of gaps, whereby such proceedings are
duly leavened with sadness, and there may be raw
recruits, uninfluenced as yet by the <i>esprit de corps</i> which
animates the older hands.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion the absentees returned intact, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
was not only a piece of good fortune, but reflected
great credit on the officers in command; in a bad
climate and under every disadvantage, such a satisfactory
result could not have been attained without constant
supervision, attention to important details, and a
thorough knowledge of the conditions of a soldier’s life,
and how to handle a body of men discreetly. It is to
be hoped that they obtained the praise due to them. It
is not always so in mundane affairs. Among notable
instances of neglect in this particular that occur to me,
I may mention a couple of cases in the Mutiny that
appeared to me especially flagrant.
</p>

<p>
A clergyman, for instance, who bore the heat and
burden of the day, was present at all the operations in and
around Cawnpore, scrupulously read the burial service
under a heavy fire, and nursed gallant Peel in his own
quarters at imminent risk to himself. All he obtained
for this heroic conduct was a scant notice in the Gazette,
not even a decoration or cross.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, a handful of officers responded
to the call and charged some guns, when the Goorkhas
had refused to advance; the thanks which they received
were hardly worth the paper they were written on.
</p>

<p>
The welcome was cordial on all sides; all hands
vied in their eagerness to carry the baggage from the
boat to the barracks, and there was no mistaking the
expression of honest satisfaction which lighted up their
faces. The men celebrated the event after their own
fashion, and the scanty means at their disposal; the
officers in theirs by a dinner which, if not aldermanic,
was at least creditable to caterer and cook in such an
out-of-the-way place.
</p>

<p>
I was honoured with an invitation, and went with the
captain of the steamer, in whose company I had to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
return to Prome the following morning. There is no
rest, they say, for some people. Having delivered over
my charge, I had no longer any immediate responsibility,
and should be a free man for about a day. The pleasure
of the evening was further enhanced by my unexpectedly
meeting an old schoolfellow, one of the officers
of the regiment. Although we had not met for upwards
of a dozen years, recognition was mutual, indeed his
face was not easily to be forgotten. A mournful kind
of beauty ran through his family in a very marked
degree; and on one occasion during the Mutiny, when
riding into a station, I recognized standing by a gun, a
brother of his, with whom I was also at school. The
former I still encounter occasionally where men most
do congregate to watch our game of games; his brother
is at rest.
</p>

<p>
One of the saddest features of a “retrospect” consists
in the thinning of the ranks of old comrades. Year by
year they fall away, leaving one feeling very old and
isolated, and new friends are but poor compensation for
those of one’s youth, around whom cling so many pleasant
memories. I well remember the day that my old
friend went into action by my side: the bullets came in
showers; men were falling fast, so indeed were the
leaves, which gathered thick about us like those in Vallambrosa.
We were five hundred against ten thousand,
but, as our men refused to advance, a hasty retreat
back into the entrenchment was our only alternative....
</p>

<p>
The party was certainly kept in full swing until a late
hour; and we had much to relate of past and present,
for there was no knowing when we might meet again.
The regiment would in time return to India, a larger
country than those at home are generally given to suppose;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
and there again we did encounter one another,
and, curiously enough, both were once more on the
war-path.
</p>

<p>
At last, we broke up; and, bidding our entertainers
adieu, the captain and myself made our way back to
the steamer, where I slept the sleep of the weary.
</p>

<p>
Had I been my own master, I should have elected to
remain for a few days at Theyetmyo, in order to look
around; but I was under orders, and literally, as well as
metaphorically, the captain was in the same boat as
myself, more work having been cut out for both of us by
those who pulled the wires.
</p>

<p>
Landing late one afternoon and re-embarking soon
after daybreak, enabled one to form but a hazy idea of
the place. I remember a very brief walk, a mess-room
and—the reader will forgive me any details of what
occurred after dinner! It was an important station, as
it guarded the line which separated our acquired territory
from that of the King of Ava, the legitimate owner
of the whole.
</p>

<p>
I noticed, however, that the position was judiciously
chosen; and was doubtless impregnable while protected
by the 1st Bengal Fusiliers who, if attacked, would have
given a good account of themselves. The men were
also more healthy on the whole than those of other
stations, where disease usually gave the doctor more
work than either sword or bullet.
</p>

<p>
Our operations had so far been confined to the banks
of the rivers; of the interior, its mighty jungles and
mineral resources, we knew little or nothing. We
merely annexed the lower half of the country, rich indeed,
but from all accounts inferior to the upper part.
</p>

<p>
Most men, weatherwise in political meteorology, prophesied
that the course of events would compel us to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
steal the whole loaf; but the time arrived considerably
later than they had anticipated.
</p>

<p>
The Mutiny, disturbances on the Indian frontiers,
European complications and the stealthy encroachments
of Russia kept us otherwise well employed; an advantage,
inasmuch as it enabled us to consolidate the territory
which we had already acquired, before impetuously
rushing further afield.
</p>

<p>
When the occasion did arrive, the succession of events
clearly demonstrated the difficulty of subduing the more
warlike and energetic races further north, at bay in the
heart of a country immeasurably more adapted to their
peculiar mode of warfare; and the annals of that campaign
reveal many obstacles in the shape of trying
marches and loss, irrespective of disease, but they also
teach how perseverance, supported by ample resources,
conquered in the long run.
</p>

<p>
With this last achievement in furtherance of our
already colossal mercantile development, it looks as if,
as far as Asia is concerned, we had at length arrived at
the end of our tether; and well might we echo Alexander’s
complaint, that there are no more worlds left to
conquer.
</p>

<p>
With the vast empire of China, which bounds our
possessions on the east, we are scarcely likely to meddle;
looking at the northern frontier, neither Nepaul nor
Bhootan would be particularly desirable acquisitions;
and as for Thibet, we shall, if wise, leave that inhospitable
region alone, except under the utmost provocation.
Our western frontier has certainly caused sufficient
anxiety, and in the event of European complications
is likely to cause more. Not very long ago, we
had a golden opportunity of rendering it unassailable;
but just then another party took up the reins of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
Government in this country, a party pledged to reverse
the policy of its predecessors. It fulfilled its promise
with a vengeance; so much so, indeed, that its advent
was by many considered synonymous with Russia’s
opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Our eastern frontiers having at length received their
geographical limitation, insatiable John Bull is now
gaining ground in the neighbouring continent, and it is
an unfortunate omen for the new departure, that at the
very outset its horizon was darkened by accusations,
which, whether true or false, must dim the halo that at
first surrounded that well-intentioned expedition to relieve
a party who, it appears, would much rather have
been left alone....
</p>

<p>
In spite of the late hour at which I turned in, I was
up on deck at an early hour next morning. With the
indispensable cup of tea and the most enjoyable pipe of
the day, the captain and myself paced the deck as the
vessel travelled down the river at a great pace, passing
objects almost as soon as they came in sight. I should
have liked more of this river life, which always appeared
to me the most enjoyable way of travelling in a hot
climate. By day, the movement created a breeze; at
night, which was much cooler than on land, one was
considerably less tormented by mosquitoes.
</p>

<p>
Early hours, so impressed upon us in my younger days
by the advice contained in a well-known couplet, were
also the rule to the advantage of every one, and they were
certainly conducive to health, if not in every case to wealth
and wisdom. A speciality of our river steamers used to
be the excellence of the food supplied on board; you
might sit down without an appetite, but the Malay
cooks would provoke one: in the serving up of fish they
were particularly successful, though unfortunately their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
own species lack flavour, while we spoil our own delicious
harvest of the sea by our lamentable ignorance of
cookery. A Malay would do more with the sole of one’s
boot than an English cook with one from the Dogger-bank;
and would make it more palatable and digestible.
</p>

<p>
When travelling by steamer on duty, the sum of
Rs. 5 per diem was deducted from one’s pay under the
name of “table money;” and, as it included everything,
it could not be termed excessive. In the matter of
liquor, the system naturally admitted of great abuse,
though in all my river trips I never saw more than one
instance of advantage being taken of it.
</p>

<p>
Long ere this, Government has probably taken a leaf
out of the book of the P. &amp; O., reducing passage-money,
and charging wine, &amp;c., separately.
</p>

<p class="p2">
And now, having arrived alongside the jetty at Prome,
it only remained for me to go ashore and report myself.
No; another duty had first to be performed, one
seldom or never of an agreeable nature; and that was
taking leave of the captain, a very good fellow, who had
studied our comfort in every way and was a favourite
all along the line.
</p>

<p>
It proved only a temporary farewell, for I often met
him again in his cruises, smoking with him the pipe of
peace and enjoying a certain dish which he knew how
to prepare <i>secundum artem</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>

<p class="post">
Uninviting as may have been the immediate surroundings
of the last place, few stations could vie with
Prome in all that was picturesque. Situated on the
left bank of the river, it consisted of a limited and
undulating tract of country, covered with fine trees,
from the branches of which hung beautiful creepers in
graceful festoons; shrubs and undergrowths also grew
thickly among the timber. The Burmese must, in
selecting the spot, have had an eye to that which nature
had already rendered beautiful; they then improved
upon it according to the canons of native art—not by
any means for the benefit of “οἱ πολλοί,” but as a
sylvan retreat, wherein priest and monks could lead a
purely isolated and ascetic life, away from the busy
haunts of men, with every facility for contemplation
and with as few hindrances as possible on the main
road to “Nirvana.” Judging from the size and number
of the Pon-gyee houses, one would imagine that the
religious fraternity must have mustered there in great
numbers, ere the spoiler turned them out and appropriated
their sacred dwelling to his own sacrilegious uses.
All is fair in war; these elegant edifices of teak, built
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
on piles along either side of the main road, and now
converted into residences and mess-houses, had, but a
few years since, presented a picture that would have
evoked ecstasies from an artist. There, shaded by the
luxurious foliage of the tamarind, dwelt the original
occupants, some reading, others sitting cross-legged in
emulation of their master, a few, maybe, imparting to
the young the doctrines of their wondrous religion.
</p>

<p>
Then, everything suggested peace and harmony;
now, alas! the bugle is for ever resounding with its
periodical “Puddings and pies for officers’ wives;”
whereat the officers would assemble alone, for their
wives—poor “grass-widows!”—were far away.
</p>

<p>
Facing the river to the right were blocks of hastily
constructed dwellings for all sorts and conditions of
men, necessary adjuncts to a large force, which had to
be lodged, fed and clothed; and some way behind these
came the “Sepoy lines.” To the left, well intrenched
and guarded, lay the Commissariat Stores, on which so
much depends when once the dogs of war are let loose.
All men, irrespective of race or colour, fight, as did
Napoleon’s soldiers, “on their stomachs;” but it is the
European element which so taxes the hard-worked
officials of the Commissariat department; they must
have their daily rations of meat, bread, porter, tea,
sugar and condiments, besides every kind of comfort,
when lying sick or wounded. And when I assert that
the Indian Commissariat department was second to
none in the world for efficiency, organization and uprightness,
I know no one can contradict me. Presiding
over this essential adjunct at Prome was a man who,
to the regret of all who knew him, died in India some
years afterwards, and we shall perhaps never look on
his like again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Burmese quarter of the town was still further to
the left, occupying more level ground and of considerable
extent. Many of the native buildings were on a
grander scale than those usually met with, bamboo
being discarded in lieu of teak.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of them we naturally constructed a
prison, near which soon sprang up that emblem of
civilization, the gallows; but I am happy to put it on
record that, during my tenure of office in a medical
capacity, it was never once used. Neither—to the
credit of the Burmese, be it said—were there many
candidates for the gaol, though I never shall forget the
amazement of the few at such an unintelligible mode
of punishment.
</p>

<p>
Of all the people I ever came across, I should consider
the Burmese the least capable of bearing such
restraint; they were so independent, so fond of freedom,
air and exercise. With our egotistic proclivities and
insular pride, we are but too prone to pounce down
upon a conquered country and force upon them there
and then our own laws and notions of the fitness of
things, utterly regardless of the material with which
we have to deal, and ignoring the impossibility of
moulding it all at once to our own complicated judicial
system.
</p>

<p>
We make no allowance for the influence of centuries
of heredity; we overlook the fact that their notions of
right and wrong are based upon a totally different code
of ethics from our own.
</p>

<p>
That faithful servant, who made away with his father’s
murderer in obedience to the laws and faith of the
tribe among whom he was born and bred, should have
merely been dismissed from the service, without being
in addition deported to the Andamans; and it would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
have been better for India in general, and an exalted
personage in particular, had his sentence been thus
simplified.
</p>

<p>
We lose sight of the fact that we are aliens ourselves,
and only in possession of these countries by might, and
not by right; our strength is that of a giant, and as
such we use it. One of the most pitiable sights I ever
saw was the incarceration of these few Burmese.
</p>

<p>
Our system was to blame and not the Assistant-Commissioner,
than whom not a kinder or more humane
man existed.
</p>

<p>
With the welfare of the people at heart, he resided
among them in the centre of the town; and the very
fact of his being able to do so in safety so soon after
our conquest speaks volumes for native principles and
his own moderation. Many a time and oft did I wend
my way through the streets of an evening to keep him
company, and return at night, without a sign of
molestation.
</p>

<p>
The opposite side of the river, which was at this point
narrower and deeper, was also hilly and laid out in
plantations of custard-apples, the fruit of which did
justice to the care and skill lavished upon them. Those
in India were very inferior to them, as much so perhaps
as is a crab-apple to a Ripston-pippin! After the rainy
season, and as soon as it was sufficiently dry to admit
of the operation, the undergrowth in and about them
was set on fire, and a pretty sight it presented at night,
as the zig-zag lines of flame ran up the hills in every
direction.
</p>

<p>
I can quite understand how this annual celebration
enriched the soil, directly through the distribution of
carbon and potash, and indirectly from its increased
exposure to the sun and atmosphere; but what passes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
my comprehension is how the trees themselves escaped
injury.
</p>

<p>
Either the rapidity with which the flames advanced
prevented any real danger accruing to them; or else
the cultivators themselves must have devised some
expedient whereby the trees were rendered fire-proof.
They could be seen superintending the operation,
regulating the direction of the flames, and beating out
any that ascended too high with long bamboos. The
soil on these hills was no doubt peculiarly adapted for
this fruit, a fact which the inhabitants probably discovered
by having seen some originally there in a wild
state.
</p>

<p>
In spite of their laziness, they were no mean cultivators,
and, as I saw on an occasion hereafter to be
related, endowed with considerable ingenuity. That the
soil of these hills fulfilled the requirements of the fruit
in question in a unique degree, I gathered from the fact
that I never came across it elsewhere. I should much
like to assign a scientific reason, based on an analysis of
the soil and the geological formation of the hills; but
I regret to say that my knowledge in this branch of
science was, in those days at all events, extremely
elementary and unpractical. I had soon special reason
to lament my ignorance in this respect, for I was to
traverse a hitherto unknown tract of country, where
nature had been exceedingly lavish of her gifts, animal,
vegetable and mineral. Advanced age brings in its
train to the majority of mankind varying degrees of
regret for neglected opportunities, the inevitable longing
after that which “might have been.”
</p>

<p>
Chosen no doubt from the facilities it afforded, as
well as for its strategical position, the military eye may
nevertheless have been attracted to Prome by the sense
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
of the picturesque; though, as it turned out, these
superficial allurements concealed such deadly enemies
as dysentery and an intractable form of intermittent
fever, which played especial havoc with the European
troops. And, contrary to all calculation, the higher
they were quartered, the more severely did they suffer.
Some European infantry, for instance, located in
barracks half-way up the hill, was reduced at one time
to a state of almost inefficiency; while the artillery-men
further inland, and in more open ground, were
much less affected. The former arrived in its full
strength, but in a few months could scarcely muster a
quarter of their number of effective bayonets. As I
passed their quarters on my morning “constitutional,”
it looked as if the men were mustering for parade in
their dressing-gowns, and convalescents filled every
verandah. But the garrison was not in very great
danger, as besides the above, two regiments of native
infantry and one of cavalry were quartered there; a
force in itself amply sufficient to cope with anything
the Burmese could bring against us. Nor was it at all
likely that they would beard the lion in his den, for, as
experience had already taught us, their fighting was as
a rule confined to remote spots in the heart of the
jungle, a species of warfare of the most trying and
unsatisfactory nature. A heavy responsibility rested
at this time on the officers in command, who found it
difficult to steer between the Scylla of severity and the
Charybdis of leniency; and their difficulties were no
wise lessened by the recent publication of the proclamation
annexing the country, in spite of the significant
fact that in reality we held little more than the actual
banks of the river, the interior being virtually a <i>terra
incognita</i>, where collisions were still the order of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
day. As might be expected, a nice point arose out of
this somewhat premature notification, with reference to
the treatment of spies taken in our camp. A detachment
in a difficult position, away from further assistance
and threatened by armed bands, captured one in
their midst. He was tried by a drum-head court-martial,
sentenced and shot, according to the usages of
war. But, said the authorities, we were at peace, and
therefore the punishment was illegal! But we were
only so on paper! War was still going on, even if it
were in a desultory fashion; and for the preservation
of the party it was deemed expedient to employ
energetic and deterrent measures. Who was the best
judge of the situation, the officer on the spot, or one
thousands of miles away? To have kept the man a
prisoner would have been no easy matter in such a
situation, besides entailing a guard and thereby weakening
a force that was already numerically small. Time
and circumstances considered, it was a mistake to
descend to such hair-splitting, as it tended to weaken
the authority of the officers, besides causing them much
unnecessary dissatisfaction. It was in fact one of those
many cases in which theory and practice cannot be
reconciled.
</p>

<p>
Soon after landing, I joined the battery of artillery
on the other side of the hills. They assigned to me a
large bungalow perched on a hillock, composed of three
rooms communicating with each other and surrounded
by a verandah. It was simply palatial in contrast with
some of my recent abodes, making me feel a person of
some consequence.
</p>

<p>
My stock of furniture was certainly somewhat limited,
but I had all that was necessary, and in such a country
the absence of anything superfluous was a decided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
advantage, tending as it did to limit the powers of
concealment of various nuisances, such as rats, snakes
and insects.
</p>

<p>
I could watch the rats with the utmost <i>nonchalance</i>
as they chased each other along my bamboos; and
many a snake forfeited his life through his inability to
conceal himself. One afternoon I observed a very
large one coiled up in the very centre of my bed, and,
justly incensed at such unwarrantable intrusion, I
grasped a long-bladed Burmese sword and advanced
to do battle. But in spite of my extreme caution, the
bamboo flooring creaked, and the reptile decamped,
not, however, before I had cut him in two. Snakes
enter houses as a rule in pursuit of the rats and frogs
which harbour there; in this instance, however, the
intrusion seemed to have for its sole object the luxury
of occupying my bed—a temptation to which he yielded
with unlooked-for results.
</p>

<p>
Others I frequently killed when capturing a frog,
which in such a case utters a series of sounds resembling
the cries of a flogged child.
</p>

<p>
The solitary position of my abode was a matter of
complete indifference to me, as I was generally out till
late, and dined every evening at the mess, besides which,
I always had writing to do when at home, and consequently
preferred being undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
The mess fare was simple; but even had it been
much more so, compensation would have been afforded
by the society one met there. From the commanding
officer downward, one and all were a refined, intellectual
set of men, among whom I spent a most agreeable time,
the pleasurable recollection of which is marred only by
the afterthought of how many perished soon after in the
Mutiny.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“Heroic Willoughby,” of Delhi fame, was there,—all,
all were good men and true!
</p>

<p>
As my sphere of duties widened to embrace the civil
department also, the place grew upon me, and I hoped
to remain there for a long time. Looking back, I often
wish it had been so decreed! Men who had resided
for some time in India thought differently, they longed
for the time when their regiments should be ordered
back.
</p>

<p>
And their wish was soon to be gratified: they returned
just in time to get entangled in the outbreak,
in which the majority of my old comrades were shot
down by the men they trusted.
</p>

<p>
I was caught in the same trap, but escaped by the
skin of my teeth. Circumstances unfortunately compelled
me to remain on for many years; but I place
it on record that from that time forward I loathed the
country and the altered mode of Government, and I
maintain, without much fear of contradiction, that under
John Company’s <i>Raj</i>, Europeans and natives were
far happier than they have ever been since, or ever will be.
</p>

<p>
At Prome there certainly was a dearth of those
amusements to which the majority of officers had been
accustomed; but this was the case at most Burmese
stations. The band and the mess were all that remained.
There was very little sport; and libraries and
billiard-tables were inadmissible, as part and parcel of
campaigning equipage; the ladies too—where were
they?
</p>

<p>
In its palmy days of yore, before the great convulsion,
India was celebrated for its sociability, for the brotherly
feelings that knit together Europeans of every denomination,
and for the deference shown them by the population
at large.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In every walk of life there is the hard lesson of how
to take the good and bad together; and there is some
justification of the way in which the officers yearned
after their accustomed dances, picnics and hunting, in
the fact that history has proved, in the most unequivocal
manner, that the man who shines in the drawing-room
and field makes the best officer under any conditions.
He possesses more self-reliance, clearer judgment, and
greater fertility of resource, not to speak of better-tuned
nerves, in an emergency, than the more modern bookworm,
whose mind has too often been developed at the
expense of his body.
</p>

<p>
If the human machinery is to work efficiently, bodily
and mental training must go hand in hand, and this
is especially necessary in the case of the soldier. The
pendulum with us is always swinging to extremes, and
the present tendency is to train the one, and leave the
other to look after itself.
</p>

<p>
The old Company may have erred in the opposite
direction, by permitting young fellows to enter their
service before, indeed, their education was sufficiently
advanced; yet, what able men they produced!
</p>

<p>
The Mutiny arose from no fault of theirs, but rather
from the evils of interference from home, by which the
door of appeal was opened too wide, weakening that
authority so essential to commanders, especially in the
East. The leaven rapidly permeated throughout the
mass, and the Sepoys, recognizing their advantage,
improved upon it, as Asiatics know how.
</p>

<p>
The “annexation of Oude” and the “greased cartridge”
episode occurred opportunely, and served as
handles.
</p>

<p>
In judicial matters we were exacting; but in military
matters we were far too lenient, the reason of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
being presumably that the supreme command was vested
in officers imperfectly acquainted with the Asiatic
character, these new acquisitions coming periodically
fresh from home, and consequently tinctured with much
of the maudlin sentiment that thrives there in certain
quarters.
</p>

<p>
In India generally, Europeans were but little given
to pedestrian exercise, partly because the youngest
subaltern could afford to indulge in a horse or pony,
partly because the country was so very uninteresting,
hundreds of miles of dead level road, lined on either
side with the useful and ubiquitous mango, and acres
of cultivation without a break, by way of relieving the
depressing monotony.
</p>

<p>
Riding put a totally different complexion on the
matter; the animals, unaccustomed to inequalities, were
well suited to the roads; the exhilarating exercise
covered a multitude of shortcomings, while hunting
obscured them <i>in toto</i>.
</p>

<p>
At Prome, however, there was more by way of encouragement
to pedestrians; well worth traversing on
foot were the many interesting roads, turning here and
bending there; now ascending a greasy hill, anon
dipping into a valley, and following up a meandering
stream, flanked with stately trees and flowering
shrubs.
</p>

<p>
On all sides, the fly-catchers with their burnished
plumage flashing in the sun, while various other birds
in gaudy livery flitted from tree to tree; woodpeckers
ran round them, tapping here and there with their
hammer-shaped bills in quest of hidden treasures, while
the agile movements of the squirrel lent additional
charm to the scene. One walk was in special favour,
leading, as it did, along the banks of the river, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
then sweeping inland, enclosing with two others a huge
space, in which lay our entire force. Its breadth and
culverts were evidence of its military design.
</p>

<p>
The life in Burmah may have been irksome to many,
but none could complain of its expense. What with
no house rent, a necessarily curtailed mess, and various
subscriptions in abeyance, military tailors realized many
an outstanding debt.
</p>

<p>
Extended credit, and proportionately protective
prices had placed purveyor and recipient on the
horns of a dilemma, from which this campaign released
them.
</p>

<p>
It must certainly have been an anxious time for the
man of business; and as he ran his eye down the list
of casualties, one must sympathize with him, as much
as is possible in the case of traders that make those
who meet their liabilities pay for those who do not.
I was young at that time, and had only advanced a few
paces on the independent road of life; and the yarns
unfolded afforded me an insight into the recesses of
human nature.
</p>

<p>
War, whether waged in a just cause or the reverse,
is always a lamentable occurrence, but this campaign
afforded another illustration of the adage relating to
an “ill wind.” To save money in such a situation reflected
no credit on any man, simply because there
existed no loophole for extravagance of any kind. It
was a case of necessity rather than choice.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the river had contracted once again into
its ordinary bed, which it does very soon after the rains
are over, I obtained a day’s leave of absence, in order
to pay a visit to a famous haunt of wild-fowl. Such
at least was its reputation, and for once in the course
of her long life, Dame Rumour had spoken correctly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
Something like an hour’s journey by boat brought
me to a perfect El Dorado of geese and ducks. When
we had reached the extensive “jheel,” or swamp, where
they most did congregate, one of my men procured
me a small native boy, who was delighted at the prospect
of paddling me about in his own canoe. I had
soon taken up my position in the bow with gun and
ammunition—those were the days of powder-flask, shot-belt
and wads—and we forthwith raised the alarm, the
immense numbers of fowls fairly blotting out the bright
sky for several moments.
</p>

<p>
I discharged both barrels into the flock, and, ere I
could look round, my amphibious little guide was in
the water, retrieving the dead and wounded, which were
all ordinary ducks and geese in excellent condition.
As this was a very likely place for an alligator, I felt
extremely nervous on the boy’s account—the only drawback
to a very pleasant and exciting day; but as he
seemed rather to enjoy it than otherwise, I tried to
persuade myself that the danger was one of my own
creating. He enjoyed both the fun and the “tip” I gave
him, for it was not every day he had the chance of
earning a rupee.
</p>

<p>
Ere many weeks had rolled by, the kaleidoscope of
military affairs was again shaken, and, to my infinite
regret, the battery was ordered elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
My country house had therefore to be vacated; and
I believe that even the colony of rats, lizards, frogs
and mosquitoes, with which I had shared it, regretted
my departure. The snakes, upon whom I always waged
unrelenting war, were doubtless mightily pleased. As
for the others, as long as they kept their place, I lived,
and let live. Their name certainly was—legion!
</p>

<p>
Whatever may have been my regret at the sudden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
and unexpected turn in the tide of affairs, very little
leisure was permitted for the purpose of brooding over
the stern decrees of fickle fortune.
</p>

<p>
Military life consists in being here to-day, there to-morrow;
and is indeed a nomadic existence, only
relieved by its eminent respectability.
</p>

<p>
“Move on,” is the everlasting dictum of War Office
and policeman; and one has, during the active years
of one’s life, but few opportunities of settling down in
the midst of one’s few household gods. This constant
moving under orders is apt to cling to men, even after
their retirement from the service; and this accounts
for the reputation enjoyed by Anglo-Indians as the
most restless of mortals.
</p>

<p>
On first returning home, they pitch their tents in
“Asia Minor” (known to some as Bayswater); thence
they move on through Bath, Cheltenham, and Leamington,
until their circuit of the island is put a stop to
by a last fatal illness. This wandering proclivity is
further encouraged by the absence of ties to any particular
spot; for the Anglo-Indian, returning after years
of service in the Far East, is ever thrown into a train
of melancholy associations by the reiterated question:
“The friends of my youth, where are they?”

<h2>
CHAPTER X.
<br />
A SECRET EXPEDITION.
</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“He deserves small trust,</p>
<p>Who is not privy councillor to himself.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
One evening when at dinner, I received an official letter,
which ordered me to proceed on the following day to a
spot some miles down the river, and on the opposite
bank. My luggage was not to exceed a specified
weight, and further instructions would await me on
arrival. I was moreover to consider the communication
of a confidential character, which pointed clearly to
some enterprise only to be revealed to those actually
concerned, and not by any means intended as food for
station gossip.
</p>

<p>
I accordingly dropped down the river the following
afternoon with my old attendant, any possible difficulty
in discovering the place having been surmounted by
their placing a look-out there to show that I was expected.
But for the unmistakably official character of
the communication which had summoned me hither, the
proceedings resembled a ruse to entrap me.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the place serve to allay such a suspicion; on
landing I saw nothing but trees and shrubs, and the
smoke from a fire some little way inland.
</p>

<p>
The look-out now assumed the character of guide,
and politely asked me to follow him to the camp, at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
which we soon arrived. Nestled among trees at the
base of the hills was a considerable force of European
and Native Infantry and Irregular Cavalry, while guns
and gunners were conspicuous by their absence. That
intelligent and useful pachyderm—the elephant—also
mustered strong, those present being strong and of
large size, evidently carefully selected for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
This formidable array of colossal mammals were
picketed apart; had they but been cognisant of their own
strength, they might have nipped the expedition in the
bud.
</p>

<p>
This largest and most sagacious of animals is also the
most docile and obedient, gifted with a good memory,
affectionate in return for considerate treatment, but
never failing to resent an injury.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps his most apparent characteristic is extreme
restlessness; viewed at any time, either his whole body
is swaying to and fro, or else one of its members; the
large ears flapping, the trunk fidgeting, or the feet being
raised alternately from the ground. He is wonderfully
observant of all that is going on around, for his eye,
though small to outward appearances, is very strong of
vision, its disproportionate minuteness being a beautiful
adaptation of a means to an end, since, were it larger or
less protected, it would be liable to constant injury in
the tangled vegetation of the jungle. Many folks are
unaware of the somewhat singular fact that twice the
circumference of any elephant’s foot, measured on the
ground, gives the exact measurement of his height.
I once gave practical demonstration of this curious fact
to the manager of a menagerie, and his astonishment
was certainly great.
</p>

<p>
The total absence of wheeled conveyances in itself
told a tale, implying an excursion into a wild and unexplored
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
country devoid of roads, for some specific
purpose known only to those in authority, while the
importance of the enterprise was to be gathered from
the fact of its being led by the Chief Commissioner
himself. His intimate knowledge of the people and
their language, to say nothing of his many other eminent
qualifications, fitted him for the post; and, moreover,
whatever he undertook, he was in the habit of performing
thoroughly. He was in fact our Commander-in-Chief.
There were, besides, two officers belonging
to the European detachment and a quartermaster with
the natives.
</p>

<p>
I shrewdly suspected that my summons to attend
was an afterthought at the last moment, the original
intention being to employ only a native “medicine
man.” I was confirmed in my suspicion by the fact
that everything was ready for a move, even to an
armoury of medicines and appliances. When and how
this force of men and elephants had assembled there,
was best known to themselves; at Prome, few if any
suspected it, so adroitly had everything been managed;
as for myself, I had not the faintest idea of what was
going on, until the scene already described burst upon me.
</p>

<p>
That evening was a very pleasant one; my welcome
was cordial, and we chatted during and after dinner,
though not even a passing allusion threw any light upon
the object or destination of the expedition.
</p>

<p>
This was my first march, and I was therefore deeply
interested in all the preliminary details, including several
readjustments of weights.
</p>

<p>
As I moved to my allotted quarters, my eyes fell upon
a very pretty scene, the first of its kind that had ever
come under my notice.
</p>

<p>
The night was fine and clear, and the silvery moonbeams
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
dancing on the river close at hand, brought out
in bold relief the whiteness of the tents under which
reposed so many soldiers. Lower down appeared the
horses and elephants, tethered <i>secundum artem</i>, the
former comparatively still, the latter still busy with
their arboreal food, and evincing signs of that characteristic
perpetual motion to which allusion has already
been made.
</p>

<p>
The camp fires were dying away, yet ever and anon a
puff of wind would fan one into flame, which lit up
the sleeping forms enveloped in thick blankets. Besides
warming the surrounding air, the fires emitted large
volumes of smoke, to the detriment of mosquitoes and
other equally unwelcome intruders.
</p>

<p>
The profound stillness in which the whole scene was
wrapped was broken only by the ripple of the river or
the occasional splash of a fish.
</p>

<p>
So absorbed was I in the scene before me, that I was,
until addressed, unaware that any other man was near
me. It proved to be my assistant, a native of much
intelligence, who ultimately showed himself a trustworthy
man, always ready to assist in his own or any
other department.
</p>

<p>
After a brief conversation with him, from which I
gathered several important details relating to the
package and transport of our available stock of medicines,
I called my valet and turned in, my last words
being those of the poet, “Call me early!”
</p>

<p>
This injunction proved unnecessary, for I awoke of
my own accord a great deal too soon, ere the darkness
had fled. Soon, however, we heard the sound of
hammering at tent-pegs, and we knew that our first day’s
march was about to commence. By the time we were
dressed and discussing some hot tea and toast under a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
tree, the first faint streaks of dawn appeared in the east,
and the force moved inland.
</p>

<p>
With the advanced guard, consisting of some troopers,
rode our Burmese guides: close on these followed the
Commissioner and officers, accompanied by a few more
Burmese, men of some standing, as was evident by their
dress and bearing.
</p>

<p>
Behind marched the bulk of the infantry; then the
elephants laden with camp-baggage, while the rear was
brought up by the remainder of the infantry and
troopers.
</p>

<p>
Roads, properly so-called, there were none; here and
there we came upon some kind of tract, but it never
lasted any time; notwithstanding, but few halts occurred,
and these were chiefly owing to signals from the scouts,
who fancied they descried movements ahead.
</p>

<p>
The country was undulating and covered with low
trees and shrubs, many of which bore bright coloured
fruits or berries, which we admired, but let alone,
knowing from experience that things fair to look at in
those lands are oftentimes dangerous to eat.
</p>

<p>
In the declivities we crossed several <i>quondam</i> watercourses,
which now contained but a few small pools.
Some little apprehension was at first entertained as to a
sufficient supply of water, and the length of the marches
had to be regulated by what we came across of this very
essential commodity. For the bipeds a moderate supply
would suffice, but the horses, and more especially the
elephants, required a large allowance, and the anxiety
was chiefly on their account.
</p>

<p>
From the nature of the country, the column was
necessarily attenuated, forming an imposing sight when
viewed from an eminence, as it moved leisurely across
country. The dips and rises in the ground made it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
appear as if broken at intervals. It is an old-established
custom, when on the march, to call a halt when about
half the distance has been accomplished; the men are
then allowed a good quarter of an hour, during which
they fall out and refresh themselves with cold tea or
water, which they carry for the purpose in bottles
cased in leather and slung over their shoulders. Very
short black pipes also come to the front on these occasions.
</p>

<p>
Officers perform somewhat similar manœuvres; and
in times of peace, arrangements are made for enjoying
such luxuries as hot tea and coffee.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day’s march the Europeans and natives
soon pitched the tents; the process of cooking made
rapid progress under the skilful hands of the natives
appointed for the purpose; the elephants, relieved of
their loads, went a short distance into the jungle, where
boughs were lopped off certain trees for their consumption.
</p>

<p>
After we had refreshed ourselves with a bath and a
good meal, we sat outside our tents chatting, and presently
turned in, having first repacked many things
ready for an early start next morning.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of some birds in the surrounding
trees, the country seemed devoid of living things, bipedal
or otherwise. The animals had doubtless been scared
by the unaccustomed noises inseparable from the march
of such a force. There was not a sign of a village in
any direction, our route had evidently been most carefully
considered beforehand, and we were steering clear
of all frequented places, with a view to effecting a
surprise.
</p>

<p>
In this way we crept stealthily along. As march
succeeded march, the character of the country varied,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
our surroundings becoming daily wilder and more
picturesque.
</p>

<p>
The jungle grew taller and thicker, numerous and
extensive clumps of bamboo reared their graceful heads
high in the air; trees became more abundant, of
immense size and venerable with age, while creepers
with thick skins and large leaves ramified in every
direction to such an extent as to render many parts
inaccessible, save on the back of an elephant.
</p>

<p>
After the first day’s march, game literally swarmed.
Of a morning, the clear, shrill note of that handsome
and delicate bird, the jungle-fowl, resounded on every
side, and when able to use the elephants, we shot large
numbers of them with a fair sprinkling of partridges.
Deer were plentiful, as also tigers and bears.
</p>

<p>
During a halt, one of the Europeans engaged in
pitching the tents happened to see a pair of eyes peeping
from a thicket close at hand, and, aiming a blow with a
mallet, he succeeded in felling a small deer, which had
evidently been too paralyzed to effect its escape. As
an addition to our table, venison was not to be despised;
at the same time the Eastern produce is very inferior to
our own, which may be said of the game generally, with
the exception of the jungle-fowl. This bird combines
elegant plumage with a piquant flavour rarely met with
in Asiatic birds, yet only when hung the proper time.
It is a very shy bird, frequenting those spots where
the undergrowth is thickest, and running for some
distance when alarmed, eventually rising a short way
from the ground, and flying along with cries of alarm.
</p>

<p>
Situated as we now were, the chance of a shot rarely
occurred, though later on we made amends. Neither,
as subsequent events clearly proved, was it wise to enter
those thickly wooded parts <i>on foot</i> in search of game.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
I was taught a lesson which eventually cured me, but
will reserve an account of it for the proper place.
</p>

<p>
Instead of marching direct on our quarry, whatever
that might be, it soon became evident that we were describing
a circuitous route, not only for the aforementioned
reasons, but also to avoid a deep and rapid river,
which would have brought us to a standstill. On we
plodded, therefore, through wilder country, coming one
day upon a few houses strongly pallisaded, but to all
appearances long since deserted. It was indeed difficult
to conceive what could have induced a few families to
migrate to such a place in the heart of a jungle swarming
with wild beasts, which must have carried off their
children and cattle even during the day.
</p>

<p>
This may have led to their departure; if chosen for
retirement from oppression, or for the purpose of contemplating
amid nature in her primæval condition, the
selection showed admirable judgment. The residential
portion of these dwellings must have been twenty feet
or more from the ground and the pallisade, which included
a circle twelve or fifteen feet in diameter, and
contained only one door.
</p>

<p>
It was a great relief to find that the settlement had
been uninhabited for some time; otherwise, had the
residents simply fled at our approach, there was no calculating
how far the news of our proximity might not
have preceded us. Still greater caution would then
have been necessary, for the Burmese, with their knowledge
of the topography of the country, might have
opened on us all the inconveniences of a guerilla warfare.
</p>

<p>
So far, fortune had favoured the brave Commissioner
whose fertile mind had conceived and organized the
undertaking. If he entertained any misgivings as to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
the ultimate success of the expedition, they never
appeared on the surface, for he was bright, cheerful and
sanguine throughout.
</p>

<p>
We were far away from any kind of help; few indeed
were aware of the expedition; and being himself the
ruler of the country, there was no one to whom he could
report progress. He was, moreover, dependent on the
integrity of those who were guiding him through a
country hitherto untrodden by Europeans, destitute of
roads and bristling with almost insurmountable difficulties.
He was mainly depending on secrecy and a circuitous
flank movement.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, he doubtless placed considerable
reliance on his thorough knowledge of the Burmese
character. Yet, in spite of this, how could he be sure
that intelligence would not by some means or other be
conveyed to the party in revolt? We have reason to
know how rapidly events and proceedings are communicated
in the East; how they travel through the length
and breadth of lands that know not the telegraph; and
if anything like a determined opposition had been
offered along the line of march, we should have suffered
great losses, until retreat would have probably been
still more disastrous than any advance. Thus the
Commissioner was unquestionably taking upon himself
a heavy responsibility and courting unusual risks, from
motives best known to himself. We could only enjoy
a satisfactory peep here and there, and indulge in conjectures;
but ere long, the curtain was to be raised and
the whole scene viewed at a glance. It was a bold conception,
and ably carried out by a master mind!
</p>

<p>
Hitherto it had not been my good fortune to come
across a teak forest, but we now skirted one. Judging
from the regularity of the spaces between the trees,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
it looked as if the process of thinning had been employed,
and the survivors were of large size, great
height and immense value.
</p>

<p>
As this was the season at which they shed their large
rough leaves, the interior of the forest was lighted up,
otherwise it must have been as dark as Erebus. In
one place, a bear was seen shuffling along as fast as
he could travel, evidently dismayed at our intrusion,
and too far off to have a shot at, even had we been so
minded.
</p>

<p>
There was then a craze for teak-wood, and, as the
forests were indiscriminately and ruthlessly felled in
this and subsequent years till irreparable mischief ensued,
this one probably shared the fate of the rest. Subsequently
our Government realized the gravity of the
situation, and appointed a forest conservancy, which,
considering the mischief was already done and the
teak requires about eighty years to arrive at maturity,
was rather worse than locking the stable-door after the
steed has been stolen.
</p>

<p>
Defoliated as they were, the sight was nevertheless
a grand one, and more than realized my expectations.
This tree has been introduced in various
parts of the East, but nowhere does it thrive as
in Burmah, the soil and climate suiting it equally well.
</p>

<p>
The largest bamboos too that I ever came across
were in this country, and I have cut specimens some
nine inches in diameter. The rough leaves of the one
and the glossy surface of the other contain a large proportion
of silica.
</p>

<p>
No wood approaches teak for ship-building purposes,
as it is easily worked, durable and insect-proof. Most
of our old East-Indiamen were composed of it, outliving
even those constructed of oak.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Since entering the “Iron Age” of ships, the demand
has greatly decreased; but this wood is still employed
almost exclusively for the purpose of decking vessels of
any size and importance.
</p>

<p>
I believe the P. and O. used formerly to send their
vessels to Bombay, where they were decked with teak
under the superintendence of Chinese carpenters, who
understood that particular branch better even than ourselves.
</p>

<p>
I shall have occasion to return to the subject of the
Teak trade in a subsequent chapter.
</p>

<p>
Leaving this forest on the left, a few days’ march
brought us to the fringe of a sparsely inhabited country,
and we came suddenly upon its one village.
</p>

<p>
So far from being afraid of us, men, women and
children approached the camp, squatted down, and surveyed
us with ludicrous curiosity, seemingly forgetting
all else. They merely sat there, looking first at one
thing, then at another; admiring the tents, but amazed
beyond measure at the whiteness of our hands and faces.
</p>

<p>
My canvas having been erected, I retired to have a
wash, and, nude to the hips, I was soon enjoying a
lather. Finding the atmosphere very stuffy, I told my
servant to throw back one side of the canvas, thereby
admitting what breeze there was.
</p>

<p>
He did so; when, what was my surprise on finding
myself face to face with some twenty natives of both
sexes squatting around my tent. On beholding me,
their tongues were loosened, and they uttered exclamations
indicative of wonder and delight.
</p>

<p>
My first impulse was to have the opening closed
again; but it was a very hot day, and after all, if my
ablutions afforded them satisfaction, there was no harm
done. Inwardly I was convulsed with laughter, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
I managed, however, to control with the aid of my
towel and soap.
</p>

<p>
They watched me dress and brush my hair with the
same interest, and were unfeignedly sorry when the
operation was concluded, and I stood before them
clothed and severe. Then it was that they beckoned
my servant, to whom they imparted their strong desire
to possess some of that wonderful stuff, which would
make them white also.
</p>

<p>
He gave them a cake of soap which they examined
with extreme curiosity, and departed. During the rest
of the day, applications for soap, coming chiefly from
the women, were numerous.
</p>

<p>
The account I gave of the scene at breakfast evoked
much merriment.

<p class="post">
Presiding at the table was the Commissioner, who,
with the rest, appreciated the ludicrous position in which
I had been placed. I do not think that he was altogether
pleased at having come across the people at all; but it
now only remained to look the matter boldly in the
face, and, as far as possible, to prevent the news from
spreading. In this I think he was successful, for the
march was continued without any attempt at opposition,
and, as matters turned out, we eventually arrived at our
destination without having to strike a blow.
</p>

<p>
At the best of times, even under cover, the natives
lack cohesion; in the open they are nowhere, being too
heavily handicapped by want of discipline, indifferent
weapons, and inherent apathy and ignorance.
</p>

<p>
It is more difficult to assign any adequate reason for
their poor show of fighting qualities when strongly
entrenched; the few who had ever faced and survived
disciplined troops and English guns probably exaggerated
their own prowess, and consequently, too, the
number and strength of the enemy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The theory of fighting appears to constitute in the eyes
of the Burmese a very amusing game: it was their delight
to build a great stockade, arm it with what weapons
they could muster, and fancy themselves secure from
even the most daring of intruders. Untaught, too, by
numerous reverses, it was also their fancy that an enemy
invariably attacks in front, so that any flank movement
completely disorganized them, all their strength having
been concentrated on the front of their building. Had
we, for example, attacked the Rangoon Pagoda—the
key of the whole position—from the front, our troops
would to a certainty have been frightfully punished;
but we moved under cover of the jungle to the east side,
where we were least expected, and its defenders ignominiously
fled without anything more than the faintest
show of resistance.
</p>

<p>
The result of coming in contact with such peaceful,
well-behaved natives inspired greater confidence into
our party; and while scarce a shot had been fired
hitherto at any kind of game, partly owing to the
nature of the surroundings, and partly because we
thought it might be distasteful to our worthy chief, no
objection whatever was now raised to a little shooting,
and it was in this wise that I encountered my first tiger
in his native haunts and majestic beauty.
</p>

<p>
We were encamped in a large open space by the side
of a somewhat broad but shallow stream, which furnished
men and animals with the best and most abundant
supply of water that we had come across since our
departure. Nor did its advantages end here, for, besides
to some extent protecting one side of the camp, its
rippling music was very refreshing to our ears as we
rested during the heat of the day.
</p>

<p>
As the result of a conversation, in which sport was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
the leading topic, it was agreed that four of us should
go in a body and see what we could make of the jungle-fowl,
which had, as usual, been crowing away that
morning all along the line of march.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, towards sunset we sallied forth, the two
officers belonging to the European detachment and their
orderlies, the officer in command of the Sepoys, and
myself, with a Burmese lad to carry my ammunition.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes’ walk brought us to the jungle, which
we at once entered, on the <i>qui vive</i> for whatever small
game might turn up, the idea of encountering anything
larger having, strange to say, never occurred to any of
us. We were soon threading our way through an
exceedingly pretty part of the jungle, amid gigantic
trees with gnarled trunks, festooned with creepers, and
inlaid with delicately-tinted and waxy-looking orchids,
that peeped out everywhere from a profusion of spotless
green leaves. These beautiful flowers, which always
appear to me to be gifted with more expression than
perhaps any other, seemed to warn us of dangers
lurking within that tangled mass of vegetation, the
haunts of the cruel python and other formidable creatures.
There is much to be said in favour of the
orchid, in spite of its lowly position in the vegetable
kingdom as a parasite, or, to let it down more easily, an
epiphyte. It is, in point of fact, a veritable robber,
though not to the extent generally supposed; for,
though it derives its sustenance from the tree on which
it grows, yet this is extracted from the effete bark, and
not from the juices. In this respect, therefore, orchids
are more sinned against than sinning; sinners or no
sinners, they are worthy of adoration, whether abroad
in their sylvan haunts or as exotics at home. Exquisite
in themselves, they show how, on so frugal a diet, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
can rival any of our favourites, on which animal and
other manures have been lavishly expended.
</p>

<p>
The forest now resounded with the report of double-barrelled
firearms, and jungle-fowl were falling on all
sides. Reloading, I followed, as I thought, in the track
of the others, but their reports sounded further and
further away as I advanced, and at length died away
completely. Now and again I hailed them by name,
but I might just as well have searched for a needle in a
haystack as my companions in such a labyrinth, so I
soon followed an independent course. That we had
scattered was not to be wondered at—indeed, unavoidable;
twisting about and facing every point of the
compass in order to avoid trees and to steer clear of
patches of thorny, low-growing jungle, both for their
own sake and for the sake of what they might harbour,
anything like keeping in touch was impossible. I found
myself, therefore, alone, but for my little ammunition-bearer,
who kept as close to me as he could, bounding
forward whenever I fired, and every bit as interested in
the proceedings as I was myself.
</p>

<p>
I had been creeping along cautiously for some time,
looking to right and left and listening attentively, when
it suddenly dawned upon me that it was time to get
back to the camp. I accordingly did so with every
feeling of confidence, but a few attempts convinced me
of the fact that I was lost.
</p>

<p>
In my perplexity I took my boy into confidence,
but, either owing to my imperfect knowledge of the
language or his timidity, he proved but a Job’s comforter.
Nor was there any help to be derived from the
position of the declining sun, as it was completely
hidden from view by the thick foliage overhead and
everywhere around; so I proceeded at random, all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
interest in the excursion having vanished, and my every
thought centred on how to get clear of the forest.
</p>

<p>
Having performed the operation of “right-about-face,”
I must surely be making progress; and it is
astonishing how, under such circumstances, a straw
seems sufficient to clutch at. I was still fresh, which
was something; a trifle warm perhaps, and well disposed
towards a pint of the <i>dimidium dimidiumque</i> of
the ancients had such been available, but, in default
of nectar, I sought another comforter, that had often
helped me to pull myself together and look an unpleasant
situation in the face. My companion looked as if he
would liked to have followed my example, but I had
not even a cheroot to offer him.
</p>

<p>
Barely ten minutes after this the jungle terminated
abruptly, and we came upon a green sward of considerable
extent, and fringed with trees and undergrowth.
It almost resembled an artificial clearing, inasmuch as
not even a shrub intercepted its continuity; and I was
on the point of crossing it when a terrific roar on my
right sent all the blood back to my heart, and a magnificent
tiger trotted into the enclosure. I was too taken
aback to move; my pipe dropped from my mouth on
to a stump, scattering its lighted contents over my feet.
The tiger was a grand specimen—graceful, sleek, and
beautifully marked, but for the moment his beauty concerned
me far less than my own slight chances of escape.
My thoughts involuntarily wandered for an instant to
that farce in which the pariah-dog enacted a leading
<i>rôle</i>—what a contrast to this awful reality! and I was
just resolving to pour the contents of both barrels into
his face, in the hope of blinding him, when he snarled
at me and disappeared, lashing his tail.
</p>

<p>
This was a great relief, for the perspiration was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
streaming down my face, and my teeth were clenched as
in death. I recovered my pipe, and looked round for
my boy. He was gone, and my calls received no
answer. I would have signalled to him by firing, but
the young absentee was in possession of both powder
and shot, leaving me with only two charges to depend
on in case of further emergencies. I was therefore
compelled to proceed alone, coming to the conclusion
that he had bolted on hearing the tiger roar, and had
either made off to his own village or else succumbed to
fear, or to <i>something worse</i>, the bare possibility of which
I dared not contemplate.
</p>

<p>
Absolutely alone! Lost in a tropical forest, with
night coming on apace, and no ammunition other than
the two charges of small shot already in my gun. This
was truly an enviable position, especially as the forest
was known to be swarming with wild beasts, such as I
had just encountered. I shouted once more for my
boy, and plunged again into the thicket at haphazard,
and in a state bordering on desperation. Anxiety and
fear quickened my steps; my eyes seemed to penetrate
further than usual, and my ears detected the faintest
sound. I was startled by the snapping of a twig under
foot, while the cry of a jungle bird terrified me. How I
wished they were all defunct, or that I had never
attempted to molest them in their hidden retreats.
</p>

<p>
In addition to my gun, I carried a stout branch, which
I hurled at every suggestive clump likely to harbour
any kind of animal. I realized to its full the couplet of
the poet—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“As in the night imagining some fear;</p>
<p>How easy is a bush supposed a bear:”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
in my case a tiger. Hope was ebbing fast, so I scanned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
the trees around, with a view to taking up my position
in one of them for the night.
</p>

<p>
Even then I should not be beyond the reach of tigers,
snakes, and black ants; while, if I fell asleep, I might
have occasion to prove the literal truth of the words:
<i>Periculosior casus ab alto</i>!
</p>

<p>
The outlook, both above and below, was certainly as
bad as bad could be, and I felt sick with anxiety, and
so weary with suspense that I almost wished the end
would come and leave me at rest.
</p>

<p>
It was, however, decreed otherwise, and to my intense
satisfaction the trees became further apart and the
undergrowth less dense, and—oh, joy!—a familiar sound
smote my ear, and I once more stood on the brink of a
stream.
</p>

<p>
This was a relief in many ways. First and foremost,
I lay my gun down, tucked up my sleeves, and drank
greedily, for I was both hot and thirsty; and then I
once more lighted my pocket companion and considered
my position. Though matters had decidedly improved,
I was still on the horns of a dilemma. We were encamped,
it is true, on the banks of just such a stream as
this; but, even if this were the identical one, ought I to
follow its course up stream or down? The pleasing
thought also occurred to me that animals are wont to
make for the water to slake their thirst during the first
watches of the night, but this troubled me far less than
the choice of direction.
</p>

<p>
The ultimate result of my calculations was a decision
in favour of moving with the stream; so I advanced
with extreme caution, looking on all sides whenever I
was following one of the many bends of its tortuous
course.
</p>

<p>
Once, a large moving object loomed some way ahead,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
leaving the water’s edge and striking inland; it was
probably a tiger, but the increasing darkness rendered
identification impossible; and my attempts to ascertain
the nature of its footprints when I shortly afterwards
crossed its path were equally fruitless.
</p>

<p>
Save for the rippling of the stream perfect silence
reigned around, a few stars twinkled overhead, and the
dark line of the forest looked more gloomy than I had
ever yet seen it. Doubtless my feelings painted the
surroundings in unusually gloomy colours.
</p>

<p>
It was now half-past-six by my watch; and on
making the next bend, I saw a light not very far ahead.
It might of course belong to a party of the rebels out
reconnoitring, in which event I should be between two
fires. Stooping down and gliding inland from cover to
cover, I approached cautiously; while, as I neared the
place, other fires came in sight, and figures flitted past
them. I crept closer and closer, resting for a few
seconds behind each convenient bush; the figures were
in the “shadowed livery of the burnished sun,” though
taller and slighter than the average Burmese. Still
more cautious, and bent almost double, I traversed the
remaining distance, soon making out every detail of the
camp I had quitted the same afternoon. Not sorry to
stand upright once more, I sauntered gaily into the
place, whistling a tune, answered the challenge and
proceeded straight to my tent.
</p>

<p>
The others were just sitting down to dinner, at which
I soon joined them; after which, in return for their
consideration in allowing me to enjoy the meal undisturbed
by questions, I gave them a full account of my
adventures, and was heartily congratulated on my
narrow escape.
</p>

<p>
Comparing notes with my fellow-sportsmen, I found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
that the whole party had scattered, returning separately,
but in good time. Captain H.—the “long one,” as we
called him—had also encountered a large tiger asleep,
and was just pushing a bullet down over the shot, when the
animal awoke, snarled at him, and walked unconcernedly
away. Considering how these animals rest during the
day and prowl about in the evening, there was every
reason to suppose that his tiger and mine were identical;
if so, its experiences that day, encountering no less than
three white faces—the captain’s, his orderly’s, and my
own—were indeed probably without precedent.
</p>

<p>
That night, I slept soundly; and we started early
next morning, for time was precious. Not long after
the commencement of this march, we came upon a herd
of wild elephants, which at once fled, making the jungle
appear as if agitated by a strong wind.
</p>

<p>
It was just as well from our point of view that they
did not attempt to fraternize with our tame ones. As
a rule they are timid creatures; but the Rogue is an
exception, and a very ugly customer to deal with,
moving at a pace far beyond anything that could be
expected of his size and awkwardness, and making the
forest resound with his trumpeting.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this encounter, the camp was thrown into
an unusual state of excitement. The Commissioner
was cool and collected as usual, but news of an important
and possibly disagreeable nature had evidently just
reached him.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, a number of padded elephants, heavily
laden with armed Europeans and Sepoys, were at once
ordered to the front, and went off in hot haste. Without
being aware of it at the time, we were within a
day’s march of a large stockade, the capture of which
was the main object of the Expedition. For a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
hours the camp was plunged in profound silence; the
remaining troops being kept under cover, ready at a
moment’s notice for any emergency.
</p>

<p>
And so we remained until the shadows of the trees
began to lengthen considerably, when one of the
troopers galloped up with a despatch, from which it
appeared that, as our force appeared in sight, the
Burmese had fled for their lives, leaving only a few
decrepid old men and women, some pariah-dogs, and a
number of cooking utensils. Thus was extracted this
thorn from the Commissioner’s side without a shot
having been fired. He out-Cæsar’d Cæsar, for he came
and conquered without even seeing! Those who were
not needed to garrison the place returned to camp that
evening, while other elephants went with provisions, &amp;c.,
for the new occupants.
</p>

<p>
From this it would appear that the Burmese were
totally ignorant of our approach until we were within a
day’s march of their stronghold, and then in all probability
only by the merest accident.
</p>

<p>
Some woodcutter in the vicinity may have spied us
out that morning and, seeing so many laden elephants
and armed men, conveyed a very exaggerated report of
our strength. On the backs of these pachyderms must
be large guns; at all events he fancied he saw them,
and reported them.
</p>

<p>
He must any way have piled on the agony, else the
enemy would scarcely have evacuated a position already
strong by nature, and rendered still more so by art,
without striking so much as a blow.
</p>

<p>
Such conduct indeed could only be accounted for on
the supposition that they imagined us in possession of
large cannon; the range and power of our guns may
have been known to some of them, and, having already
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
profited by the lessons of hard experience, they were
by no means anxious for further instruction.
</p>

<p>
The evacuation was described as one of the most
disorderly, precipitate, <i>sauve qui peut</i> affairs which it is
possible to imagine. They melted away on the principle
of “The devil take the hindmost,” and they
certainly left very little for his satanic majesty.
</p>

<p>
Some allowance must, however, be made for their
behaviour. To their intense bewilderment they were
about to be attacked in the rear, a direction from which
they least expected it; and, while still cogitating over
the unwelcome intelligence, they suddenly behold a
herd of elephants bearing down upon their stockade as
fast as they could be urged along, each teeming with
redcoats armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>. A belt of forest moreover hid
our force till close at hand, when its sudden appearance
created a “panic.”
</p>

<p>
All doubt and uncertainty were now at an end, and
the sole remaining impediment to the peace of the province
had now been removed by a bold strategy, in
which were displayed some of the finest qualities of the
human mind—true courage, self-reliance, ability to
act on one’s own convictions, and far-seeing perspicuity.
</p>

<p>
And yet our Commissioner was still anxious. The
finale must have rushed upon him so hurriedly and
unexpectedly; the relief from a state of tension to one
of an opposite nature was also too abrupt, and the
reaction gave him sleepless nights, during which he
doubtless reviewed the momentous proceedings of the
past three weeks. Extremes meet and produce like
effects; and a sudden, unexpected stroke of good
fortune will sometimes unhinge us more than an
unlooked-for disaster.
</p>

<p>
All this was mere conjecture on my part, for, as I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
have already mentioned, he never allowed his own
troubles to be shared by others.
</p>

<p>
Another important qualification that characterized
him was an instinctive knowledge of the exact moment
at which to strike the decisive blow. It goes without
saying that he must have employed trustworthy spies
who, in the garb of mendicants or some other guise,
succeeded in gaining admission into the stockade, heard
all that was going on, and reported that afternoon the
state of consternation in which the inmates were at the
time. Nevertheless, had the enemy but delayed a day
longer, there might have been some awkward resistance.
</p>

<p>
All round, then, the future Sir Arthur Phayre displayed
the highest qualities, not only of Governor in a civil
capacity, but also of General, <i>au fait</i> in the military
branch as well.

CHAPTER XII.
<br />
“EL DORADO.”

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Lovely indeed the mimic works of art,</p>
<p>But Nature’s work far lovelier.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
The march was resumed next morning under the most
favourable auspices, though still in the same methodical
order; for although we were no longer in continual fear
of molestation, it was nevertheless incumbent on those
in command to make assurance doubly sure.
</p>

<p>
News arrived <i>en route</i> that “all was well” in the
stockade, and that there were no signs of any gathering
in the immediate neighbourhood. While traversing
one of the last fringes of forest, our ears were struck
with a peculiar droning sound, which seemed to come
from our right. We were puzzled as to whence such a
sound could proceed; it became louder as we advanced,
and as we emerged from the forest, the cause of the
disturbance met our astonished gaze.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the valley ran a broad and tortuous
river. Rather to the left lay the stockade on what at
first sight appeared to be an island, though a closer
inspection showed that it was connected by a short,
narrow neck with the mainland.
</p>

<p>
The land, which was under cultivation up to a certain
point on either side of the river, was being irrigated by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
enormous wheels, curiously constructed of bamboo,
much after the fashion of paddle-wheels; and the exquisite
balance of the axles, combined with the action
of the water, went as near as possible to “perpetual
motion.”
</p>

<p>
As these huge wheels revolved, the bamboo cylinders
poured a continuous stream, the flow of which was
regulated by floats, into a trough on either side, joined
by a third, through which it was conveyed to the fields.
There were a number of these wheels on either side the
river, and by means of a dam, the water was turned in
any required direction, with a force proportioned to
its breadth. Altogether, I never saw anything more
ingenious.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the cultivation on the opposite side, the
country presented a still more hilly appearance, and
was covered with trees of immense size and considerable
variety. It was a picture of wealth and fertility, as
charming a view as could well be imagined; and when
the camp was pitched near the stockade, man and beast
gladly looked forward to a few days’ rest amid such
enchanting surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the proclamation issued by the Commissioner,
the agricultural population soon gained confidence
and returned to their various occupations,
seemingly only too glad to be allowed to do so.
</p>

<p>
Buying and selling became the order of the day,
bazaars were opened, and before forty-eight hours had
elapsed, a friendly feeling animated both parties, resulting
in mutual confidence. Burmese men, women and
children moved about as if nothing had happened, a
little curious, maybe, and occasionally squatting near
the camp, attracted more by the European soldiers than
anything else.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These constituted in their eyes the greatest attraction;
and the lady portion in especial regarded them
with unconcealed admiration. Oh, the sameness of
human nature! We all know the dangerous interest
that these uniforms will inspire at home, from the
domestic upwards; and here was the same magnetic
attraction far away from civilization among the most
unsophisticated of races.
</p>

<p>
On the day of arrival, many started off at once to
inspect the stockade; but I curbed my curiosity until
the sun was down in the west, when I knew I could
proceed with greater comfort.
</p>

<p>
The entrance was well guarded, though open to all
except the Burmese.
</p>

<p>
As I have already pointed out, the greater portion of
its circumference was protected by the river, which it
consequently commanded above, below, and across.
</p>

<p>
No wonder, then, that its original tenants thought
themselves secure against the invader, until the unwelcome
news suddenly burst upon them that we had out-manœuvred
them!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with their customary mode of military
engineering, the face of the stockade presented a curved
line of stout timbers driven into the earth at an angle,
and almost touching one another.
</p>

<p>
Behind, the natural level had been considerably
raised, with a view to putting it above the influence of
any abnormal flood.
</p>

<p>
The inner circumference was lined with wooden and
bamboo houses, around which lay a pile of half cooked
food and <i>débris</i>, just as the fugitives had left them.
</p>

<p>
A gang of men were, however, soon at work clearing
a place and preparing suitable quarters for a permanent
garrison.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When I had inspected all this to my own satisfaction,
I made my way to the bamboo bridge which spanned
the river a short distance below.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the alarming manner in which it creaked
and swayed, it was very strong, though, by the very
nature of the material of which it was constructed,
adapted only to very light traffic. In the middle of the
stream the water was deep, but so clear that one could
distinguish every pebble on its gravelly bed. The sight
of numbers of large fish darting hither and thither
at once aroused my Waltonian proclivities, and I recollect
that some of us tried our hands at the art with
considerable success, though I have unfortunately no
record of the size or species of the fish.
</p>

<p>
Most of my notes, together with everything else,
perished a few years later in that wretched and disastrous
Mutiny; could I but have foreseen it, I should
have elected to remain in this El Dorado, and turned
Buddhist!
</p>

<p>
An opening at the middle of this bridge afforded a
glorious place for a dive, and, as far as we could ascertain,
there were no alligators about, the water was too
clear for these loathsome amphibians, which—being of
the dirt, dirty!—delight in the solitude of a muddy river
bedded with slime and ooze.
</p>

<p>
From this bridge, which was a favourite <i>rendezvous</i>
of an evening, the view above was exceedingly grand,
especially as the rays of the setting sun streamed along
the valley in a gorgeous blaze, the like of which—and
that only on a very small scale—I have only seen at
Govilon on the Usk.
</p>

<p>
The dangers attending any expedition into the jungle
afoot having been impressed upon the party in general
and myself in particular, we determined to rove in search
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
of that delicate chanticleer once more, but perched this
journey on the backs of elephants. We made up the
same party as before, each with an elephant; but this
was a different affair, inasmuch as a quartet of these
animals, advancing in line with stolid indifference to
any obstacle smaller than a large tree, routed out the
game wholesale.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that the jungle-fowl, partridges and hares
swarmed especially near the edge of the forest, and concluded
that they had, with a creditable eye to the main
chance, taken up their abode as near as possible to the
surrounding fields of paddy and other grain.
</p>

<p>
As there were eight barrels between us, the fusillade
was continuous and the havoc considerable; what it
would have been with breech-loaders I know not; but
these were comparatively primitive days, and the delay
consequent upon the process of reloading afforded the
birds some respite.
</p>

<p>
Nor did every shot take effect, for the undergrowth
was thick and the birds were strong and active; besides
which, with the driver immediately in front, it was no
easy matter for any one like myself, unaccustomed to
firing from the back of an elephant in motion, to shoot
in an oblique direction. Still, we managed between us
to keep the larder well stocked during our stay there,
though I fear I was more prominent as a consumer than
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
A cold bird for breakfast was very appetizing; at
lunch not to be despised; and not lacking customers
when roasted for dinner.
</p>

<p>
These excursions were certainly most enjoyable; but
there is no rose without its thorn, and none know the
invariable truth of this better than those who have
resided in the East.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In this particular locality grew a rampant creeper,
fascinating to behold, but woe betide the unlucky individual
who chanced to shake the plant while passing
underneath it.
</p>

<p>
Hanging from various points among the surrounding
trees, among which it twists and turns, may be seen
large racemes of Papillonaceous purple blossoms,
harmless, except for their unpleasant smell. At a latter
stage, however, when they have podded, the outer surface
becomes covered with fine, brittle hairs, which shower
down whenever the creeper is agitated. Should they
lodge on the naked skin, the irritation becomes maddening
in the course of a few minutes, increasing as one
scratches. It is the <i>Mucuna pruens</i> of botanists; in
popular phraseology, cowage or Cow-itch. Strange to
say, on this occasion three out of the four elephants
steered clear of this undesirable “thing of beauty;” the
fourth did <i>not</i>, and its occupant, Captain H——, the
short one this time—received a dose on the nape of his
neck which caused him to struggle as if he would pull
his head off his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
He would without a doubt have inflicted serious injury
on his neck, had not a native suggested a remedy: if an
apothecary’s shop had been available, we might have
found something less disagreeable and equally oleaginous,
the quality on which its efficacy mainly depended.
In lieu thereof, we proceeded to a village where cows
were kept, and the remedy was applied.
</p>

<p>
The natives have great faith in it here as in many
parts of India. Formerly, it was considered an excellent
vermifuge, and was administered incorporated with
treacle, honey or syrup. How the rest of us escaped the
same annoyance was a wonder!
</p>

<p>
The other drawback to the pleasures of this kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
sport was the tiring movement, half jolting, half lounging,
of the elephant.
</p>

<p>
Given the choice under ordinary conditions, I had
rather walk ten miles than ride an elephant over two;
bad as he is, however, the motion of a camel is a thousand
times worse. There may be camels and camels,
but agonizing are the best.
</p>

<p>
The stockade having been swept and garnished for
the reception of the men detailed for this especial garrison
duty, and friendly relations having been established
with the natives, the elephants conveyed our equipage
over a ford, and the pedestrians crossed the bamboo
bridge, to a point on the other side of the river, where
the camp would remain a few days preparatory to our
final departure. This was a diplomatic test of how our
friends would fare when we had marched off altogether.
</p>

<p>
The surroundings were still more wild and picturesque,
the hills were also more broken, often almost perpendicular,
and covered with very fine timber.
</p>

<p>
One glen in particular was extremely interesting from
the number of images of Gautama perched on every
available rock, it was evidently a place of resort for the
pious aspirants to the true Nirvana, where they could
contemplate in the midst of primæval nature, and far
from the madding crowd. At the same time, I never
saw a more likely-looking spot for a tiger; which would,
for a true disciple of Buddha, constitute rather an
advantage than otherwise, affording a good chance of
another transmigration!
</p>

<p>
There were also a few temples, and excavations,
which led—goodness knows where! Buddhists have at
all times shown a preference for underground temples,
as well as a special aptitude for constructing them.
</p>

<p>
A huge tree might be seen here and there, or rather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
its configuration in <i>white ash</i>. For some purpose or
other—most probably cooking—a fire had been lighted
at its base, spreading to the tree and rapidly consuming
the decayed wood. The fire would thus smoulder
on, until trunk and branches were consumed and the
ash fell <i>in situ</i>.
</p>

<p>
There were other prostrate trunks so completely
petrified as to be hard as adamant; and the steps leading
up to one of the temples were carved out of the
fossilized remains of trees. Here, then, there evidently
existed a highly fossiliferous stratum; and it was a
source of deep regret to the Commissioner and myself
that time and opportunity did not admit of further
exploration in that interesting locality.
</p>

<p>
It was interesting to see how silica or iron pyrites
can particle by particle permeate through the interstices
of animal and vegetable tissues, thoroughly reproducing
and replacing their lineaments to the minutest particular.
A transverse section of one of these trunks would
present the same appearance as wood—pith, medullary
rays and concentric circles, and from the last named one
could obtain a fair estimate of its age.
</p>

<p>
Once organized, endowed with sap and a circulation,
giving out oxygen and absorbing carbonic acid,
and performing a number of other functions, it became,
under special conditions, nothing but a mould for the
deposit of inorganic material, which permeated its
structure by some almost inexplicable molecular attraction.
</p>

<p>
Constant wear had so told on these steps, that they
were slippery to a degree; and, armed as we were with
heavy boots, great caution was necessary when descending
them.
</p>

<p>
Being moreover numerous and very steep, a fall would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
have resulted in broken bones. The natives could run
up and down them barefooted like so many cats; and
were inwardly amused, no doubt, at our awkwardness,
though far too polite to betray such unseemly exuberance
in the presence of the “Lord-High-Chief-Commissioner!”
</p>

<p>
A most unusual combination of excellent soil and
climate, assisted by so perfect and unique a system of
irrigation, stamped the valley as a place of productiveness
out of the common.
</p>

<p>
In those days, the country at large enjoyed a considerable
reputation for tobacco, which, when cured,
was remarkable for its dark colour and somewhat rank
flavour.
</p>

<p>
I preferred it, however, to what “Trichys” were made
of; though I only smoked the cigars when better were
unavailable. The price was sufficiently tempting to
decoy many, and to the officers of the ship in which I
went out, I forwarded several thousand of them at the
apparently improbable cost of a rupee a hundred.
</p>

<p>
It would be idle to add that the price rose rapidly
soon after our occupation of the country, as everything
invariably does in those places that we merely
frequent!
</p>

<p>
In 1852, Pegu ponies cost Rs. 30; in 1858, Rs. 300
were asked and given. The fact is, both were novelties;
and what Englishman will not pay a ruinous price for a
novelty! I am of opinion that tobacco was not indigenous
to Burmah, for the history of that important
plant points rather to a western origin and a gradual
spread eastward; while, with the single exception of the
Manilla, it deteriorates the further we advance in the
latter direction.
</p>

<p>
A Manilla is, I confess, a choice article; but compared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
with the genuine Havannah, the difference is as
great as that between a Stilton and a Dutch cheese.
Climate and curing are certainly important factors;
but, even in perfection, they cannot compensate for
certain qualities in the soil, found only in the west.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, this valley yielded at any rate the best
to be had in a country where men, women and children,
who cannot get tobacco, smoke an article composed of
very fine chopped wood wrapped in a leaf.
</p>

<p>
Of grain, the principal was rice, a larger and coarser
variety than that found in India or at Akyab; but we
had no opportunity of seeing it in the fields, as it
had long been cut, and they were irrigating for other
crops.
</p>

<p>
It is the crop of which the Scripture saith, “Cast thy
bread on the waters, and it shall be found after many
days.” The ploughman, with his primitive scarifier
and his pair of buffaloes, stirs the mud, while the sower
flings the seed broadcast in his wake. Ere long a green
film is perceptible at the surface; next come the blades
and clusters of flowers on single stalks; finally, the
water dries up and the crop ripens.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of the plantain, or banana as it
is called in this country, the season for fruit was not.
This exception, however, was sufficiently luscious to
make the appetite grow by what it fed on. It is a fruit
that nature has provided with a whole list of recommendations;
it is obtainable all the year round, as
the young shoots spring up of themselves from the
rhizomes, causing the plantation to spread independently;
it may be eaten at any time and with anything;
is both cheap and nourishing; and, last but not least,
as soon as the skin has been removed and the downy
layer scraped off, there are no stones, cores, or pips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Any one who has once made a lunch of bread, butter,
cheese, beer and <i>plantains</i>, will, I guarantee, repeat the
experiment; only the <i>correct</i> way of eating the fruit is
after the downy covering has been removed, a process
which, while it involves a little additional trouble, results
in a very appreciable difference.
</p>

<p>
As the longest day must come to an end, so did
our sojourn in “El Dorado” draw to a close, for affairs
had settled down sooner than was expected, and out of
regard for economy, it was considered unnecessary to
keep the troops out any longer.
</p>

<p>
The native contingent was to garrison the place, and
in that respect I wished I had, for a few months at least,
been part and parcel of the same. But, alas! the
“white face” cannot change his skin, whatever he may
do as regards his spots.
</p>

<p>
Once more, then, we made a move in a north-easterly
direction this time to Theyetmyo, where the camp was
to break up <i>in toto</i>.
</p>

<p>
We now marched through a more elevated tract of
country, neither so undulating nor so wild as on the
other side of “Jordan,” and more thickly populated as
we approached the Irrawaddy.
</p>

<p>
This march was, compared with what had preceded,
naturally a tame affair, as we were no longer on the
tiptoe of expectation. We had moreover entered the
“promised land,” and after having tasted of its delights,
we were going back to the ordinary duties of life.
</p>

<p>
Marching for six weeks without a specific object is apt
to grow wearisome; the abnormally early hour of rising
in semi-darkness; the noise of tent-peg hammering, and
the sudden collapse of the tents; and the hideous noises
made by any camels that happen to be present—all
these conditions are extremely trying. As a beast of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
burden, the camel is a very useful creature, and
there his qualifications end. In disposition he is a
veritable savage, the process of lading him requires
extreme caution, for with the slightest provocation, or
without it, he will crane his lanky neck and endeavour
to bite, treating any one he can lay hold of much as a
terrier does a rat. Failing to bite, he utters the most
dismal sounds imaginable, proceeding apparently from
his very bowels; he kneels down under protest, and
only after much tugging at his nose; and rises with such
a jerk and grunt, that any articles not properly lashed
on are hurled into space. The two periods, therefore,
of loading and unloading these amiable creatures are
extremely trying; while for riding, where the choice
lies between a camel and a donkey, I should, unless I were
in a desperate hurry, unhesitatingly choose the latter.
</p>

<p>
This time we shook hands with the officers of the
frontier garrison from the land side, and were as
hospitably entertained as before.
</p>

<p>
They had heard of our proceedings by means of the
organized runners instituted for the purpose; from this
quarter alone could succour have reached us in case of
need. They too must have made a detour, though but
a short one; and after all, a demonstration in front
would probably have sufficed, for the Burmese, finding
themselves between two fires, would have decamped in
a stampede.
</p>

<p>
With but periodical instalments of news to vary the
monotony of life from day to day, the details of our
expedition proved very acceptable, and were devoured
with special eagerness by those in whose veins flowed
the love of sport.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, from what I afterwards heard, leaves of
absence were since spent <i>not far</i> from the recently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
acquired “El Dorado”! Then indeed the reign of
peace enjoyed by animals and birds in that hitherto
favoured region must have come to an abrupt end. A
force greater than their own invaded their solitudes, once
so free from our insatiable propensity to take life in all
its lower forms.
</p>

<p>
By this time the game has in all probability been
scared far away; and it may, for all I know, be safe to
have a picnic where once the tiger had his lair, or one
may wander without even the chance of a shot through
tracts where the shy fowl once strutted in numbers,
consequential and pugnacious as usual.
</p>

<p>
Maybe too, bungalows and barracks now dot its
original outskirts, where balls and picnics are of frequent
occurrence, while shooting and hunting are the order of
the day.
</p>

<p>
I should certainly, for the sake of comparison, like to
see the place as it now is; a military band, playing perchance
at one end of the stockade, would certainly
sound divinely in that valley.
</p>

<p>
Alas! if I were only a Buddhist, I might be cheered
by the hope of visiting that earthly paradise in another
form.
</p>

<p>
The camp broke up shortly afterwards, and I returned
to Prome with our chief and a few others. We had
described a considerable circle during the past month;
little more than a month, and it seemed more like a
year.
</p>

<p>
In connection with that march, now nearly forty
years ago, a somewhat singular coincidence occurred to
me in the summer of 1889 at that paradise of cricketers,
Lord’s. While I was conversing at the refreshment
bar with an acquaintance, the subject of Burmah cropped
up, and I happened to refer in detail to this particular
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
expedition. “So well do I remember it,” I was saying,
“that I could mention the names of the officers concerned,
though I have not come across one of them
since.”
</p>

<p>
I then proceeded to fulfil this undertaking, and had
just named the one who remained behind in charge of
the garrison, when a voice behind me exclaimed, “I am
that individual.”
</p>

<p>
We had probably met many times before in that
enclosure, maybe sat near one another; but seven-and-twenty
years tend to alter <i>men</i>; and unless that keynote
had been struck, no recognition would have ensued,
as in the following spring he joined the majority. He
was a regular attendant at Lord’s, and had, he told me,
occupied the same seat for many successive seasons;
the following year I looked for him in vain—his place
knew him no more!
</p>

<p>
He was a keen sportsman and a first-rate shot, and
nothing pleased him better than being left behind at
Mendoon, the real name of my “El Dorado.”

<p class="post">
Thus far, the tide of prosperity had been flowing without
a check; we had visited many scenes, encountered
dangers and surmounted difficulties, when a sudden
and unexpected ebb set in.
</p>

<p>
I had quite made up my mind to remain in the
country on the principle that a bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush; besides which I was a little
incredulous as to the oft-repeated and over-estimated
advantages of India, and by no means eager to partake
of its imaginary delights. Calcutta was odious,
and Rangoon, in comparison, a paradise; while, besides
enjoying excellent health, I was saving a goodly
number of rupees, and making many friends. Hitherto
the gates of Burmah had been closed to ladies, for
whom “No Thoroughfare” had been the stern decree;
but all this must ere long be cancelled, and then what
an influx there would be of grass widows and perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
too unmarried belles, tempted to try their fortunes in
fresh woods and pastures new!
</p>

<p>
For some time to come, the comforts and pleasures
might be inferior to those of Indian stations, but then
there would be the reunion of loving hearts, that could
find bliss in a cottage, even where the roses and honeysuckle
were not.
</p>

<p>
The other day I came across a little book, “The
Queen of Flowers,” which the author dedicated to his
wife, and my thoughts were carried back to the date
at which it was written, the days ere chivalry had fled
and men had contracted the bad habit of talking disparagingly
of the gentler sex. Now, in the height of
their selfishness, they shut themselves up in their clubs,
where they pore over the papers, criticize passers-by,
and enjoy the fat of the land!
</p>

<p>
With us at that period, civilization was only at its
budding stage, but nowhere perhaps did the plant make
more brilliant progress than here, under the fostering
hand of its Chief Commissioner, who paved the way
for the prosperity which was to follow.
</p>

<p>
Some there were who vilified the land in no measured
terms, but only such as missed certain comforts to
which they had been accustomed. The leaven is
working among the rising generation, who, unless
pampered with all manner of luxuries that we were
unacquainted with in my young days, profess to find
life scarcely worth the living.
</p>

<p>
Not choice, but dire necessity compelled me to quit
a country so pregnant with future advantages. I was
standing one morning by the bedside of a patient, when
a shiver passing through me warned me that the fever
of the place had at length taken hold of my system.
</p>

<p>
I was in for a very stiff attack of the quotidian or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
daily variety, so intense indeed that it defied such
supposed antidotes as arsenic or quinine.
</p>

<p>
The “bacilli” must have originated from a strong
and determined race of microbes, for the “cold, hot,
and sweating” stages were unusually protracted, and
unaffected by quinine in 30-gram doses, which nearly
blew the roof of my skull off, and certainly paralyzed
my organs of digestion.
</p>

<p>
After a fair fight, medicine succumbed to microbes,
and I had to beat a retreat.
</p>

<p>
A river trip failing to have the desired effect, I
determined to try the sea. I was accordingly carried
on board a steamer early one morning and placed in
an easy chair under an awning, where I reclined, totally
indifferent to all around, and perfectly willing to be
heaved overboard. My appetite had completely
vanished, and for several days I had eaten only oranges,
solid food having been utterly distasteful and tobacco
equally so.
</p>

<p>
The bell struck for breakfast, and the captain tried
to coax me down into the cuddy, but without success.
Towards evening, however, I suddenly felt hungry, the
first time for many days past, and I actually managed
to get through a good round meal, followed by a quiet
smoke on deck.
</p>

<p>
The voyage lasted a week, at the end of which time
all traces of the fever had completely vanished. The
snake was, however, only scotched; for the next
twenty-five years it periodically raised its head feebly,
always of course when least wanted or expected;
generally when I was going to bed, and once even at
the most awkward and critical period of an accouchement.
</p>

<p>
This intermittent recurrence continued until I left
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
the East for good and all, when it expired in a singular
fashion. I had been suffering for some time past from
the most painful boils, all of which had vanished, save
one on my leg. Some ten days after my arrival in
Europe, and while still in Germany, I was seized one
morning with a most acute pain in the region of the
abdomen, followed by an attack of the <i>old Burmah
fever</i>, from which I lay insensible for three days. On
coming round, my attention was at once drawn to a
spot on my leg which felt icy cold, and I found that
the boil had mortified and was black as a coal. It
came out with a charcoal poultice, leaving a circular,
deep excavation, which only healed after many weeks.
</p>

<p>
One of the numerous eccentricities of this disease is
to lie dormant in the system for many years; in my
own case the “bacilli” appear to have concentrated
themselves in the boil, and, after having killed it, must
either have died themselves, or come bodily away
with the tissues, for I have, during the past twelve
years, never suffered the least approach to ague.
</p>

<p>
The specific germ of this disease will, without a doubt,
soon be isolated either in this country or on the Continent:
there is a current idea that the mantle of medical
discovery has descended upon our friends across
the water to our own exclusion; an idea against
which such names as Harvey and Jenner alone cry
trumpet-tongued.
</p>

<p>
At the same time some nicety will be requisite to
distinguish between those producing quotidian, tertian,
quartan and more irregular forms; how it comes to
pass that these germs can be in abeyance for many
years, and then return to life and activity, is so far a hard
nut to crack.
</p>

<p>
Heat, moisture and vegetation are a combination
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
that produce the most virulent germs, hence the
dangers attending the period in the East when the
rains are drying up.
</p>

<p>
Two of the three chief causes used also to operate
with disastrous effect in the days before the Lincolnshire
fens were drained.
</p>

<p>
Just as in all countries we can estimate the character
of any soil from its natural vegetation, so in India,
the appearance of its inhabitants is a sure indication
of the healthiness of a district. A leaden complexion,
for example, betokens an enlarged spleen, due to constantly
recurring attacks of ague, and where this is on
the increase, the locality is an unhealthy one.
</p>

<p>
Unpleasant as such an experience unquestionably is,
one can scarcely help being struck by the strange
symptoms produced by the circulation of this poison
through the system; shivering, accompanied by icy
coldness and an insatiable craving for everything warm,
inside and out, is succeeded by violent perspiration,
and a similar and opposite longing for everything
cold. The worst of it is, too, that the germs, nowise
routed by this outpour, live to fight another day!
</p>

<p>
The entire phenomenon is due to a specific impression
on the nervous centre, or what is popularly
called the spinal marrow, the brain remaining as a
general rule uninfluenced. The cellular, spongy spleen,
acts as a reservoir into which the blood can flow, when
driven by certain emotions from the surface; but for
this, the stream would probably overwhelm what our
distinguished lecturer used to call the tripod of life,
viz. the heart, lungs and brain.
</p>

<p>
From repeated attacks, the spleen will lose its
elasticity, becoming enlarged to such an extent as to
occupy the principal portion of the cavity in which it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
resides, and withal so exceedingly brittle, that a push
or even a deep sigh will cause it to rupture, resulting
in almost instantaneous death.
</p>

<p>
The germs are also guilty of other eccentricities, of
which perhaps the most remarkable is inducing an
attack one day in a pregnant woman and the next
in her unborn child.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore impossible to overrate the importance
of the discovery of specific germs, for it must lead to a
more rational treatment of many diseases, a mode by
which they can be acted on direct, instead of through
that long-suffering organ, the stomach.
</p>

<p>
In one disease of Asiatic origin we know that the
functions of that organ are so completely in abeyance
that any medicine administered through it is either
unabsorbed or rejected.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, it will be a happy period for suffering
humanity when some process is brought to light by
which hypodermic injection of a germicide produces
immediate contact.
</p>

<p>
Such a discovery will doubtless take time; but then
Rome was not built in a day, and the marvellous contributions
of Jenner, Harvey, Simpson, and Lister were
the result of years of patient study and untiring research.
And what a result! Think of the millions
that have been saved by vaccination from a loathsome
disease, of the floods of pain that have been averted by
the use of anæsthetics; of the manner in which atmospheric
germs have been kept at bay, while the surgeon
searches for a deep-seated aneurism or performs an
amputation! Pasteur’s inoculation for that harrowing
disease, rabies, is progressing slowly but surely; and
the discovery of Koch—based on the presence of
“bacilli” as the <i>fons et origo malorum</i>—will probably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
lead to results of which we can at present scarcely form
an idea.
</p>

<p>
In India cholera is endemic and devastating; in this
country we have scrofula, struma or tubercle. Neither
respects persons, attacking rich and poor alike, the latter
being particularly subject to tubercle for reasons which
need no explanation in these days, when education
stalks through the length and breadth of the land,
dragging pianos, science, and art in its train.
</p>

<p>
We may therefore hope that the cure of “intermittents”
will be performed on the same model; then will
the alkaloid of cinchona descend from the position of
anti-periodic and febrifuge to the level of a valuable
tonic.
</p>

<p>
Just as the gardener must thoroughly fumigate his
greenhouses with tobacco in order to rid his plants of
aphides, so must these “bacilli” be attacked early and
thoroughly, and then I feel sure that sea voyages would
be attended with better results.
</p>

<p>
I am aware that one swallow does not make a summer;
but, taking into consideration the palpable
improvement mentioned above, only one deduction
could fairly be made as to the beneficial effects of
sea air.
</p>

<p>
The average time spent by me in any one place
during the two years I had been in Burmah was about
four months; the next three years this increased to
seven; and the year afterwards it fell to a week.
</p>

<p>
A rolling stone may gather moss, but is almost sure
to drop it again; in my second nomadic stage, a clear
sweep was made of all that I had accumulated, and, by
this time, the surface had probably become too slippery
for any to cling to.
</p>

<p>
But it is not my intention to enter into the particulars
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
of the next three years, for my book has already
swollen like a mountain stream, and I have more to
relate about the part of our dominions I was now
leaving. The curtain falls; and, after the manner of
the dramatic author, I must ask the reader to imagine
an interval of nearly four years before it rises again
upon the land of Gautama the contemplative.
</p>

<p>
And, as the audience are looking round the house, I
may as well finish this chapter by forging a few connecting
links.
</p>

<p>
Those mean “bacilli,” mixing with my pure blood,
hurled me from a happy position and forced me to encounter
not only cloudy weather, but a hurricane of
angry passions dark as Erebus. The first cloud was
comparatively no larger than a man’s hand; but it
rapidly spread, soon blotting out the azure vault of
heaven.
</p>

<p>
Instead of returning when my leave had expired, I
was persuaded in some unaccountable manner—still
perhaps under some subtle influence of the fever—to
join a regiment, with which I marched for six weeks
through a country the monotony of which is not to be
described.
</p>

<p>
Having obtained “Privilege leave” for a month, I
should have a fortnight for looking about, leaving a
week for the journey either way.
</p>

<p>
Instead of carrying this programme into force, I found
myself—oh, irony of fate!—marching in a diametrically
opposite direction. The destination had been depicted
in glowing colours, and I found it commonplace, not to
be compared with Rangoon or Prome.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Two years afterwards the sky cleared again for a
period of six weeks, after which it became darker than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
ever; for no sooner had I settled down in a comfortable
manner with a young wife, than the Mutiny burst upon
us in all its fury, scattering everything to the four winds,
ourselves included.
</p>

<p>
It is well known that during a campaign soldiers of
every denomination keep in good health; whereas the
hospitals fill soon after peace is proclaimed.
</p>

<p>
In the one case they are kept from flagging by
activity and excitement, hope of distinction, and “seeking
the bubble reputation even in the cannon’s mouth;”
but, when the “dogs of war” have been chained up
again, their spirit barometer falls suddenly and low.
I have noticed the same with our principal trees
during and after a heavy storm.
</p>

<p>
The Mutiny formed no exception to the rule; climate,
weather, and every kind of hardship were forgotten, as
Europeans marched with impunity under the most
trying conditions to a conflict tinctured on both sides
with the worst elements of human nature.
</p>

<p>
Having witnessed some of the worst episodes of the
Mutiny—the sudden shooting down of trusting officers;
arson, massacre, and pillage; blowing from guns, beheadings,
and such like cheerful proceedings—and,
having marched with camp for many months from pillar
to post, the reaction necessitated a thorough change;
and, as a return home was impossible, I decided upon
a trip round the Bay of Bengal, which brought me once
again in contact with Burmah.
</p>

<p>
Before bringing this chapter to a close I wish to
allude to a painful subject, which is, however, of too
much interest to all connected with the East to be
omitted.
</p>

<p>
Wise people at home are pleased to find fault with
the order of matrimony as applicable to officers abroad,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
and their arguments would carry more weight with
them were they directed to the anxiety entailed in supporting
children at home.
</p>

<p>
That ordeal is unquestionably its principal sting, not
from a pecuniary standpoint, but from the sad record of
the treatment they endure when their parents are far
away and helpless to shield them.
</p>

<p>
Confining myself to personal experiences, I have
found relations far ahead of any others for sheer
cruelty. One of them, herself a mother, surpassed the
rest in her artistic brutality. I have to lay at her door
the fate of my eldest son and the early death of two
sweet daughters. She was well paid, but turned and
stung us as soon as our backs were turned. With such
a dearly-bought experience I turned to the stranger.
The age of advertising “Happy homes for children,
whose parents were going abroad,” was then in its
infancy, and not yet raised to a fine art as now-a-days.
</p>

<p>
We tried one; and a short trial sufficed. However,
what we failed to find at home we met with abroad. It
is, I know, the fashion to say everything bad about
foreigners, but all I can say is, that, whatever be their
faults, their sense of duty is at least equal to their
greed for gain, which is more than can be said for many
at home.
</p>

<p>
Marriage, therefore, to nine-tenths of the European
population in the East is shadowed o’er with this dark
and lowering cloud.
</p>

<p>
Many of our periodicals teem with advertisements
anent the “happy home,” in which all the advantages
of a thorough moral and intellectual training, combined
with much motherly kindness and fatherly discipline,
are set forth in glowing terms. Specious as are these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
insertions, the places themselves prove on inspection
still more so—charming people, salubrious locality, and
most desirable surroundings.
</p>

<p>
The scenery has been well got up, and the inimitable
acting is worthy of a better cause. The inconsolable
widow, so passionately fond of children, so anxious to
drown her thoughts in occupation, and resolved never
to marry again, is to be shunned like a cobra.
</p>

<p>
One of these, whom I have reason to remember, produced
excellent testimonials, and took a house by the
sea, where she entertained the parents sumptuously
before their departure, winning their regard and the
affections of the little ones; and as soon as father and
mother were gone, a complete change came o’er the
spirit of her dream. The children were utterly neglected,
and, but for the interposition of a friend, heaven knows
what would have become of them!
</p>

<p>
This growing thirst for the <i>care</i> of children hailing
from the East has its mainspring doubtless in that
universal regulator of thoughts and actions, money: the
parents pay well and punctually, generally too in
advance; and as some thousands of miles intervene
between them and their offspring, the <i>care-takers</i> have
the whip-hand all round.
</p>

<p>
Their strength is that of a giant, and as such I have
ever found them use it. The amount of direct and
indirect cruelty practised upon their helpless charges is
simply appalling. The despised Hindoo despatches a
female infant for whom he can anticipate no dowry;
the enlightened European sacrifices male and female
alike for reasons still less valid. Infanticide is extensively
carried on in this country under the euphonious
and rural <i>alias</i> of “Baby Farming,” a process by which
infants are permitted to die by inches—the result of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
starvation and neglect, whereas the more merciful
Oriental has his suffocated almost before full birth.
</p>

<p>
Indian legislation has almost stamped out the evil by
vigorous and well-timed measures, while the machinery
employed to effect the same purpose at home falls very
short of the desired end. Ask those genuine philanthropists
who pass their time amid the poor quarters of
our over-populated towns and villages, what goes on
<i>sub rosa</i>, aggravated by the modern facilities for insurance,
which more than covers the simple funeral
(expenses).
</p>

<p>
Periodical fits of indignation likewise surge up at
home against the line of conduct adopted by the Indian
Government with regard to the continuance of the
opium-traffic. There is something sublime in the public
disregard of far greater evils at our own door; though
any well-informed physiologist can demonstrate that
excessive smoking of opium is less deleterious in its
effects than excessive consumption of alcohol.
</p>

<p>
The former exalts the imagination to a region of
blissful dreams, where it can revel in all that is bright,
and even the succeeding depression is not accompanied
by any injury to either brain or stomach.
</p>

<p>
Alcohol, on the other hand, irritates the nervous
centres permanently. A very large slice of our home
revenue is flavoured with alcohol and tobacco; and our
Indian Government also derives much support from
opium. But there is a mighty difference: the Chinese
are supplied from India with a pure, unadulterated
article. What <i>is</i> unadulterated in modern England?
Echo answers.
</p>

<p>
Without further delving into the abysmal and prolific
mine of our misdoings and shortcomings, I think
I have succeeded in directing the reader’s attention to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
the subject of the treatment of our young ones that we
are compelled to leave to the tender mercies of relations,
friends, and strangers.
</p>

<p>
Children from the East require even greater care than
those born at home; and there ought therefore to be
some safeguard, some compulsory registration and
reliable inspection.
</p>

<p>
My own experience may perhaps be an exceptional
one—I hope and trust that it is so—but if such things
can be done in the green tree, what may not occur in
the dry! It is time we bestirred ourselves to legislate,
for something is rotten in the state of Denmark!

CHAPTER XIV.
<br />
“LEAVE OF ABSENCE.”
</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="o1">“There is a divinity that shapes our ends,</p>
<p>Rough hew them how we will.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
The selection of the route narrowed itself to that of
“Hobson’s choice”; for the embers of the Mutiny were
still smouldering in various quarters, where the roads
were consequently unsafe. I was therefore compelled
to reach the sea by river, and was the more ready to
adopt this course as an old friend and his wife were
going as far as Moulmein.
</p>

<p>
My antipathy to the country was by this time as
deep-rooted as the lilac crocus in autumn, and has never
since relaxed its hold. I felt I must leave it at any
cost, while the thought of ever returning weighed upon
me like a day- and night-mare.
</p>

<p>
The India of the past was irretrievably blotted out by
the Mutiny; henceforth no dependence could be placed
on anything; there was no safe anchorage, all was
adrift.
</p>

<p>
The pack was always being shuffled; pay, rank,
nomenclature, uniform and precedence were distributed
<i>seriatim</i>, each deal being declared a false one.
</p>

<p>
Of that huge pudding, made up of England’s possessions,
our Indian Empire certainly contains some of the
plums; and young men are naturally not backward at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
competing for them. What is to be the end of all this
feverish competition I do not care to think, for these
are congested days, and, for want of a comprehensive
scheme of emigration, we at home are striving to make
a pint hold a quart.
</p>

<p>
With extended emigration, smaller holdings at home,
and a tariff more equitable to our own producers and
less so to foreigners, something might possibly be done
to allay the sufferings of mankind.
</p>

<p>
It was refreshing to hear the sound of the paddle-wheels,
and to find ourselves moving rapidly with the
Gangetic stream, which was, as usual, flowing swiftly
past before the end of the monsoon. We needed this
help, for there were several hundred miles between us
and the sea, which we could traverse only by day.
</p>

<p>
Pleasant as was the sensation of leaving the country,
we were not a merry party by any means; some were
leaving behind those who had been very dear to them,
while others were hard and fast in the dread clutches of
disease; and the prospects of nearly all were utterly
ruined.
</p>

<p>
Lower down, we had to run the gauntlet of a stronghold
still in the hands of the rebels, who might fire
into us; and the consequences of a round shot striking
the ship might be undeniably unpleasant. But we
steamed past “danger point” at a great pace, without
a sign of molestation, never dreaming in our fancied
security that a far greater danger was lurking near us,
in the shape of a plot to destroy the vessel, fostered by
treason on board, which was only frustrated by the
captain’s promptness.
</p>

<p>
The next day brought us alongside the jetty of what
I remembered as one of our liveliest stations; in the
old days it contained a European regiment and several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
native ones. I took the opportunity of going ashore;
turning to the right along the main road, I approached
the European quarters on the one side and the bungalows
on the other; but all was forlorn and forsaken, a
sad contrast to the gay scene of eighteen months ago.
</p>

<p>
The scene was depressing in the extreme, and carried
my thoughts back to the many old friends who had
recently gone to their account. I was only too glad to
get on board again; and my thoughts, as I sat there
on deck, were not of a rosy hue.
</p>

<p>
The events of the past two years seemed as a dream;
perpetually on the move by land and water, exposed to
all manner of dangers; once a prisoner, deprived alike
of luxuries and necessaries—all this was enough to
make one recoil. But the rope which bound me to the
country was a strong one, and the only way I could see
of cutting it would have been a leap from the frying-pan
into the fire.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I was infinitely poorer than when I first
came to the country. With the exception of a scanty
wardrobe, everything I possessed—house, furniture,
books, plate—had been ruthlessly swept away in the
Mutiny; and there were souvenirs of the past which
no money could replace.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of moment occurred till we were nearing the
end of our journey; when the aforementioned plot to
run the vessel ashore at a very dangerous spot came to
the knowledge of the captain, who immediately took
the helm himself, after the steersman proper had been
duly placed in irons. He afterwards confessed, and was
handed over to the civil authorities.
</p>

<p>
If anything was wanting to complete the prevalent
gloom, it was furnished by the death of a passenger
shortly before reaching Calcutta. In the very early
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
hours of the next morning, my friend and myself saw
him consigned to that capacious repository, mother
earth.
</p>

<p>
When the rising sun had dispersed the heavy pall of
vapours, the City of Palaces was bad enough in those
days; but words would fail to describe the sickening
effluvia that prevailed in the early morning. Years
after, I recognized the same at Naples!
</p>

<p>
On this occasion—I believe I have already mentioned
the episode—I got a double dose of it, for I mistook
the hour, and consequently arrived much too soon.
</p>

<p>
The <i>rendezvous</i> was in the immediate vicinity of that
filthy river, the Hooghly, on whose turbid bosom
floated various carcases in every stage of decomposition;
crows perched on the putrid remains of defunct
Hindoos, digging their beaks into the more tender
corners; while some of the bodies became entangled in
ships’ cables, and not a few were washed ashore on to
the black ooze that covered the banks. But for the
intervention of tobacco, I should have been poisoned.
Courtesy has compelled me to give Calcutta its popular
title; but the “City of Sepulchres” would have been
far more appropriate.
</p>

<p>
The somewhat ambitious plan which I now had in
view was to visit the various places of interest on the
eastern side of the Bay of Bengal as low as Singapore;
then to cross to Ceylon, and thence to Madras and the
far-famed Neilgherry Hills, and, lastly, back to—purgatory!
Man can, however, but propose; and I was
doomed to accomplish not more than one-third of the
distance. The ebb had evidently set against me, and
seemed inclined to have a long innings. It is hard
work pulling against it year after year; the eternal
fitness of things seems deranged; and but for the hope
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
which “springs eternal,” how many more would give up
the struggle!
</p>

<p>
But even here the wind was somewhat tempered to
the fleeced human animal, for I started in ignorance,
and a measure of compensation was vouchsafed me, as
much, I suppose, as I deserved.
</p>

<p>
Well-remembered places hove in sight as we steamed
down the river at a rapid pace and once more imbibed
a draught of sea-air. The bay, although quieting down
after the storms of the monsoon, was still much too
lively for indifferent sailors, few of whom put in any
appearance on deck, and fewer still at the festive cuddy.
</p>

<p>
The first port we touched at was Akyab, celebrated
for its capacious harbour and extensive rice-fields.
Backed as it is by hills of considerable altitude, which
were clothed at this season in their richest verdure, the
approach to the port was exceedingly picturesque, and
the effects of the alternating lights were particularly
beautiful as the clouds passed across the sun, and a hill
enveloped in the gloomiest shade would of a sudden
burst into a splendour of emerald green. Further down,
the hills abutted on the sea, which broke against them
with great force, displaying thereby a line of foam of
terrible import to any vessel that should be unfortunate
enough to get stranded there.
</p>

<p>
The harbour, which would contain several European
fleets combined, is approached by a deep, yet narrow
entrance between two perpendicular rocks, necessitating
cautious steering by steam, and still more careful
handling of a vessel under canvas. This passed, it
suddenly expands into a sort of lake; on a very small
scale, Lulworth Cove on the Dorset coast, between
Bournemouth and Weymouth, somewhat reminds me
of it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The bungalows, each surrounded by its garden, were
arranged from the rock along the shore, and the plantations
were at the zenith of their beauty. There were
but few vessels riding in the harbour, which would,
however, ere long, be crowded by the vessels that
convey thousands of tons of rice to all parts of the
world.
</p>

<p>
Some of the residents showed us over the place as
far as that part of the promontory known as “Scandal
Point,” from its being the spot most in favour with the
residents, who would assemble there of an evening to
enjoy the breeze and a cigar, and gossip about things
in general. They seemed for the most part bright and
cheerful; and in spite of their isolation, their existence
amid such surroundings, with good shooting in the
neighbourhood and good fishing in the harbour, must
have been tolerable.
</p>

<p>
Passing Kyouk-Phyao and several other places, we
came to a small island not far from the mainland, inside
which our adventurous captain had a mind to take the
vessel. Although this was not the orthodox course,
and attended, moreover, by considerable risk, we had
unlimited faith in our navigator, and were consequently
pleased with the idea.
</p>

<p>
The venture proved more arduous than he had anticipated,
necessitating the utmost caution and constant
heaving of the lead. The water was so clear that I
could in many places see the rocks and seaweed, among
which great fish were darting in the utmost consternation
at the appearance of such a leviathan.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of the many inevitable turns and
twists, our progress was of the slowest. In some places
we were almost close enough to have leapt ashore, if so
minded; and to any one watching from the bows, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
forgetting the pranks played by refraction, it seemed as
if we must strike the rocks every moment. The island,
which presented but a tangled mass of vegetation, the
abode of birds above and reptiles below, was undeniably
pretty; not sufficiently so, however, to risk a steamer,
and we were not sorry when we once more emerged
into deep water.
</p>

<p>
The idea of thus going out of our way and courting
danger emanated from the captain, a man of great determination
and courage, who, being fearless at sea
himself, never bestowed much consideration in this
respect upon the “landlubbers” entrusted to his care,
though his kindness and attention in everything else
were unequalled.
</p>

<p>
This reliance on his own judgment was unbounded,
too much so indeed to the shipowners’ way of thinking;
and for the many years during which he commanded
certain sailing-vessels in which speed was essential, he
maintained the reputation of being the most “carrying
on” man in the service; but the cost of wear and tear
of spars and other paraphernalia must have been
enormous.
</p>

<p>
Some time after leaving the island we steamed up
the Irrawaddy, and I again beheld the town of Rangoon,
which, since the time when I had landed there fresh
from England six years previously, had grown beyond
all recognition. An embankment had sprung up along
the face of the river, behind which were substantial
buildings of all kinds—residences, banks, warehouses,
every sign, in short, of brisk trade and increasing
prosperity.
</p>

<p>
I at once went ashore, anxious to see if anything
remained of the old stockade and the old quarters;
alas! a severe epidemic of cholera was at its height,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
and we were not permitted to penetrate further than
the frontage of the river.
</p>

<p>
I had, however, the unexpected pleasure of shaking
hands with the Commissioner, and should have dined
with him, but for the fear of carrying infection on board.
He was but little altered; the same winning smile and
the same drawn pale face as of yore.
</p>

<p>
Sitting on deck that evening and listening to the
ripple of the water as it flowed by us, I could not help
wondering how it would have fared with me, but for
that fever, which drove me from the country. I should
without a doubt have possessed a long array of figures
denoting rupees at my banker’s, whereas I could now
muster but my pay; I should also have been spared
the losses and miseries of the mutiny, and separation
from a wife, but two months after marriage, on whose
account I had to borrow money, that I might keep her
comfortably at home until the country had settled
down again. In all probability I should even now
have been busy in the very place I was now gazing on
in the pale light of a fitful moon, and should at any
rate have been in a position to retire many years before
I actually did, from a land in which I could no longer
take the slightest interest. The light had become
feeble in the extreme; and a mocking fate has ever
laughed at my frantic efforts to make it flare up again.
One by one, I am laying my darlings in the cold earth;
had I remained, a mound of earth would have sufficed
to cover my own remains; and, as far as this life is
concerned, that might have been for the best!
</p>

<p>
The event of that dire scourge augured unfavourably
for the sanitary arrangements of the place, or for the
result of interfering with a virgin soil hitherto covered
with vegetation. During my two years of knocking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
about in the country, I had to deal with plenty of
fever and dysentery, but not a single case of cholera
ever came under my notice, either in natives—Burmese,
Madrassees, Punjaubees, or any other -ees—or among
the Europeans. The Burmese left sanitation to nature;
but then they were unquestionably stronger than any
other race that ever came within my experience;
enjoying singular freedom from deformities, blemishes
and malignant growths, and more than the average
immunity from contagious diseases, at all events until
the conquerors mixed with them.
</p>

<p>
Not very long ago, we had to grapple with these
hydra-headed monsters; but before we could do more
than scotch the snake, the Act was repealed. The
medical profession stood aghast at such puerile sentimentality
being allowed to guide our legislation, in
which we are ever apt to “strain at gnats and swallow
camels.”
</p>

<p>
But they raised their voices in vain; and the dire
results attending such a course are even yet undescribable.
</p>

<p>
Except for the landing of a few passengers, a fairly
strict quarantine was maintained, and we steamed away
early the following morning, bound for Moulmein, an
important station some way up the Salween, almost due
east of Rangoon, and across the Gulf of Martaban.
</p>

<p>
I had calculated on transferring myself at this point
to another steamer trading to Penang and Singapore;
and was therefore glad that we arrived a few days before
her date of departure, as I should thereby be enabled
to see something of the place in the interval. In due
course we reached the mouth of the river, indicated by
a lighthouse perched on a rock to starboard. From
some peculiar conformation of the land, its waters are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
navigable for vessels of large burden at any season of
the year, while its mouth is free from anything in the
shape of a bar. Though deep, it is very narrow; and
its water was wonderfully clear for that of a tropical
river at the close of the monsoon, when thousands of
tons of earth are generally being carried to the sea.
</p>

<p>
I mused over the likeliest reason for this exception,
and was not long in thinking of the teak forests, with
which the country is covered.
</p>

<p>
The rainfall averages rather more than 120 inches in
these latitudes, and even this sheet of water cannot
wash down the soil in any appreciable quantity, for the
leaves break its fall, and the earth is bound together
by countless roots.
</p>

<p>
When we were about halfway between the mouth of
the Salween and Moulmein, we made out the smoke of
a steamer coming down at a considerable pace. The
captain, having scanned the approaching craft with his
glass, coolly informed me that it was the boat by which
I intended to reach Singapore. I rushed below to
gather up my traps; and by the time I was once more
on deck, we were abreast of the new comer; an active
interchange of signals was going on, and the boat in
which I was to be conveyed was about to be lowered.
Then ensued an ominous silence, on which the captain
came to me with the pleasing information that she was
bound for Calcutta “for repairs”! A tale is told of a
criminal being led to execution and meeting an unattractive
female on the way to the gallows. He is
offered life and liberty, on condition that he marries
her at once; but one look at her face is enough, and
the wretched man, covering his face with his hands,
implores his gaoler to “drive on!” and get the worst
over.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
</p>

<p>
No; I had safely turned my back on Calcutta, and I
was not minded to return there just yet. Still, it was
a blow from which I recoiled; and, thanking the captain
for his trouble, I retired to chew the cud of this last
stroke of ill-luck.
</p>

<p>
Stranded, I told myself, and not one-fourth of the
intended trip accomplished! The relentless ebb tide
was evidently running dead against me, implacable at
any price.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the elasticity of my nature, I did not
long remain in low spirits; what had happened
was beyond my control, but as brooding would not
mend matters one iota, I resolved to make the best I
could of this unexpected <i>contretemps</i>. No doubt I
entered the “Cave of Despair,” sat down there and
discharged a large quantity of pent-up steam; but I
blew it off quickly, and not, as some prefer, in tiny
intermittent jets. There are in fact periods in the lives
of most of us, when the use of a safety valve becomes
absolutely necessary; and I soon cooled down to the
resolution, that my only course would be to start afresh
and try the Western coast, since the Eastern had proved
so treacherous and unreliable. The vessel would remain
a week or ten days, sufficient, if properly utilized, for
hunting down all the “lions” of the place.
</p>

<p>
My one difficulty, which had reference to a shakedown,
was soon solved by my friend, who promised to
get me an invitation, at all events until I could find
suitable quarters.
</p>

<p>
And now I came out of the cave altogether. He was
as good as his word, and I soon received an invitation,
which was—need I add?—accepted. Englishmen,
who never visited the India of yore, are unacquainted
with the true meaning of the word “hospitality.” The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
very fact of being able to entertain a traveller with the
best the house could produce, seemed to afford positive,
undisguised pleasure. There was a heartiness about it
unknown at home, where, what with the coldness of
our climate and the still greater frigidity of our natures,
the practice is not to accept hospitality unless in a
position to return it.
</p>

<p>
Around the fascinating custom in the East, that
blessed alike the giver and the recipient, there still
lingers a halo of light in my recollection, standing out
in bold relief from the wreck which was soon to follow.
</p>

<p>
The rapid spread of railroads, main trunks and ramifications,
naturally lessened the opportunities for exercising
such kindly sympathy, for the increase of hotels
and refreshment rooms was simultaneous.
</p>

<p>
I once occupied a bungalow close to the main road,
and travellers pulled up at it as a matter of course, as
readily indeed as if there had been a signboard over
the door. The sheep and poultry, too, may have lent the
scene the additional charm of domesticity; for, besides
having charge of the Gynee (small oxen) Clubs, I had
pigs, fowls, ducks and geese of my own, and cultivated
moreover every foot of land around my house.
</p>

<p>
After a short row, followed by a still shorter drive,
I found myself installed in a very comfortable house;
and as my advent was unexpected, I had to be shunted
to a corner, a very comfortable one, however, on which
my hostess had evidently expended an amount of taste
and ingenuity. Two things only interfered with my
night’s rest; the one consisting in a large and repulsive
lizard crawling round my pillow.
</p>

<p>
It was quite harmless, no doubt, but it was the
extraordinary size of the creature—it resembled a young
alligator—that attracted my attention, and made me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
hope that it too would go to rest as soon as the light
was out.
</p>

<p>
The other drawback to sleep was the absence of the
thud of the steamer; and the perfect stillness reigning
around positively kept me awake—such creatures are
we of habit.

CHAPTER XV.

MOULMEIN.
</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
“Gutta cavat lapidem non vi, sed sæpe cadendo.”
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
The capital of the Tenasserim provinces is situated on
the left bank of the river, about half a day’s steaming
from its mouth. It is, if anything, even more picturesque
than Prome; and, at that period, civilization had
made considerable strides, calculated to enhance its
beauty, in the shape of good roads and tasteful houses.
The site on which it was built was of an undulating
character, with imposing hills in the background, between
which intervened a swampy belt, inundated
during the monsoon, and under cultivation when the
waters had subsided.
</p>

<p>
From motives of convenience and salubrity, the
native and European residences were built parallel to
the river, in a line extending over several miles.
</p>

<p>
Once again my eye rested on houses built on piles,
and they appeared so familiar, that I could scarcely
realize the fact of having for the past four years been
associated with any other. The European houses
boasted roomy verandahs, protected from the prevailing
glare by luxuriant creepers.
</p>

<p>
Teak and bamboo entered largely into their composition,
while the roofs were covered with “shingles,”
or flat, thin boards cut into fixed sizes and laid on after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
the manner of tiles. They resisted water wonderfully,
but whenever it poured—it never <i>rained</i>!—the noise
was such as to drown all attempts at conversation.
Perchance a shower would descend in the middle of a
meal, and the hush would then be as great as if a punkah
had suddenly given way in the hot season, or a
steamer with heated bearings had suddenly come to a
standstill in the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
In the native quarters too, the houses were more substantially
built than anything I had seen elsewhere,
and the excellent sanitation was a bright feather in the
cap of the Commissioner, as well as those under him,
who had to deal not only with Burmese, but with a
medley of Chinese, Malays, Karens, Shans and Madrasees,
who had settled in the place and were conspicuous
by their industry.
</p>

<p>
Of these, I found the Chinese by far the most amusing;
and it was a right down pleasure to ransack their
shops for curios. They certainly appeared to me a
unique race, what with their strange physiognomy, style
of dress, their independence and way of rendering
English.
</p>

<p>
The cream of our intercourse lay in the process of
bargaining, wherein they displayed much temper, which
I fear I encouraged rather than otherwise.
</p>

<p>
By way of a set-off, however, I found to my dismay,
when I came to pack, that I had accumulated more
china than I knew how to dispose of. And I may here
mention, by way of warning to others, that ere long it
was all “lost, stolen, strayed or broken.” Such a collection
in my possession at this time would be exceedingly
valuable, for every item was of its kind genuine, and not
the rubbish which passes muster nowadays.
</p>

<p>
A considerable number of Chinese, attracted to Moulmein
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
by the shipbuilding carried on at the docks, had
settled down as carpenters, in which capacity they have
earned golden opinions in every quarter of the globe.
</p>

<p>
Even in exile, away from the Flowery Land, the
Celestial clings to his pig, that white, sleek, well-bred
animal, which has so improved our own stock. M.
Huc was among the first to enlighten us with regard
to the inhabitants of China and Tartary; and some of
his remarks about the Chinese border on the marvellous;
as, for instance, their expertness at telling the time of
day or night by the appearance of a cat’s eyes, and
their method of preventing a donkey braying by tying
a weight to his tail.
</p>

<p>
And these are not mere travellers’ tales.
</p>

<p>
At midnight, a cat’s eye is at its fullest stage of dilatation,
gradually contracting till midday, when it represents
no more than a longitudinal slit.
</p>

<p>
By patient observation—and who can beat the Chinese
for patience?—the stage of dilatation or contraction
constitutes a very fair index; not perhaps for those who
are dependent on trains, but for all daily purposes in
less sophisticated lands than our own.
</p>

<p>
It was also demonstrated to M. Huc’s entire satisfaction,
that in order to bray, a donkey must have his
head, ears and tail erect, so that if the last named be
kept down by a heavy weight, he has not a bray in his
composition.
</p>

<p>
During one of my evening walks, I met a Chinese
funeral procession; the coffin, as customary, was large
and ponderous, and the unfortunate bearers seemed to
stagger under the load. All the followers were busy
throwing pieces of tissue paper into the air, which were
carried here and there by the wind. Greatly perplexed
as to the meaning of this strange proceeding, I made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
inquiries, and found that their object was to cheat the
devil, the papers being imaginary bank notes, for which
his satanic majesty had, they believed, a great weakness;
while he was engaged in collecting them, the
body could be buried in safety, and, once in the earth,
he had no power over it.
</p>

<p>
They passed me on their way back, rejoicing exceedingly
at the success of their stratagem, laughing and
joking, as if they had been assisting at a wedding
rather than an interment.
</p>

<p>
Besides being good carpenters, they were <i>facile princeps</i>
as leather-workers; and once a Chinaman has encased
your feet, you will be reluctant to employ any
other nationality, be it even a Frenchman, though he
comes second best.
</p>

<p>
Having said this, I have said all the good for John
Chinaman that I can—the rest is simply nowhere!
</p>

<p>
He is steeped in independence, being very unpunctual,
and exceedingly brusque into the bargain. Keeping
you waiting until it suits him to bestir himself, he will
come forward with, “What you want?” “Boots
mended,” is the rejoinder. “Very good; I mend.”
“When ready?” you ask—remember, he can only
understand his own kind of English. “You come next
week,” is his ultimatum. You go next week, and the
boots have not been touched. “How is this?”—“Oh!
I too busy; you come another time.” “But when,
you old thief?”—“Next week I make ready,” and he
vanishes into the back premises. For artistic and
systematic thieving, too, he has gained a world-wide
renown; while as for his other virtues—well, “all men
are liars,” and Chinamen form no exception to the
general rule.
</p>

<p>
And now I must give some little account of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
wonderful vegetation, which eminently characterizes
this part of our possessions.
</p>

<p>
The most conspicuous among indigenous trees is unquestionably
the Jack-fruit, of which several may be
seen in every garden, along the roadside, and shading
the houses, in which latter capacity it is not to be beaten,
for the thick, green, glossy leaves are very numerous.
As an article of food, it ranks somewhat less highly,
for a European needs some moral courage to approach
the fruit, for a reason to which I have already alluded;
though a native esteems it as honey in the comb, and
will gorge to repletion on it, and then have a little more—if
it is to be had!
</p>

<p>
Standing isolated, it is certainly more striking in
appearance than when growing in the jungles; and one
is particularly attracted by its curious tendency to grow
fruit on the trunk.
</p>

<p>
The elongated mahogany-coloured seeds are, when
roasted, palatable and nutritious; while its wood, which
is much sought after for special purposes, takes a high
place for durability.
</p>

<p>
Not nearly so common, but surpassing it beyond all
range of comparison, is that crowning triumph of the
vegetable kingdom, the <i>Amherstia Nobilis</i>.
</p>

<p>
This glorious plant, than which even a poet’s imagination
could conceive nothing more beautiful of its kind,
is of the Papillonaceous order, a trifle too symmetrical
perhaps to be artistic; it grows to the height of about
thirty feet, and on the dense mass of light green, pinnate
foliage rest large racemes of bluish-purple flowers
in great profusion.
</p>

<p>
Following closely on its heels is the <i>Poinsiana Regia</i>,
a native of Madagascar, naturalized in some parts of
India, but not met with here. The <i>Amherstia</i> is, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
indigenous to these parts, flourishing in a limited
area.
</p>

<p>
I do not think the specimens introduced by a friend of
mine into the Calcutta Botanical Gardens thrived particularly
well, neither am I aware whether it is to be found
among our exotics at home. In a lofty glass house,
with a high temperature, saturated atmosphere, and rich,
loamy soil, it might flourish. The finest specimen I ever
beheld was in the Commissioner’s ground.
</p>

<p>
Several seeds of its near rival germinated in my own
greenhouse in Herefordshire, but the heat was insufficient
to carry them through the winter, though the gardener
at Moor Park, to whom I gave some seeds, kept them
in a flourishing condition for several years.
</p>

<p>
Various kinds of acacias and mimosas perfumed the
air and delighted the eye; and the beauty of many a
garden was considerably enhanced by well-kept clumps
of the graceful bamboo and the elegant plantain. The
display of floral wealth was also considerable, but there
is a limit to my memory.
</p>

<p>
Those were the days in which whole forests of teak
were cut down with a recklessness impossible to understand
under any administration; no thought was taken
of the future, which must take care of itself. Forests,
instead of being thinned, were absolutely cleared on a
principle of penny wise, pound foolish, which characterizes
those of our own agriculturists, who refuse to
replace worn-out fruit trees, because they themselves
may not live to see them grow up and bear. Considering
all that their forefathers did for them, such wanton
selfishness is a little surprising—even in men! Day
after day, huge rafts of teak, in charge of a Burmese
crew, were floated down the river to the timber-yard.
This had been going on ever since the monsoon set in,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
at which time this river, to the depth of which I have
already alluded, is subject to sudden rises of twenty feet
and more. One of the sights of the place was to watch
the elephants at work stacking these ponderous pieces
of timber; and, knowing from habit exactly what was
required of them, they certainly set about it in a most
intelligent and methodical manner, with little or no
prompting on the part of their drivers. Anyone watching
them at this occupation could also form some idea
of their colossal strength, a power which they themselves
are apparently incapable of appreciating, and which
they willingly delegate to the service of man. Few
animals are more easily tamed, and once domesticated,
the desire for liberty seems to die out in them for good
and all. The Burmese turn them into the jungle to
browse, just as we do horses into a field; when they
require one, they have but to walk a short distance and
call any one of them by name, when the pachyderm
leaves off feeding and follows his master like a dog.
The mention of these sagacious animals brings to mind
an omission. On our march to Mendoon, that I related
some chapters back, we lost a number of the finest
specimens; but on careful examination, I could find no
specific cause beyond enormous distension of the colon.
To administer poison is in itself no easy matter, for
anything in the shape of medicine, however adroitly
concealed, is usually rejected. Yet some powerful and
subtle vegetable alkaloid must have gained an entrance,
and we became positively alarmed at the frequency with
which such losses recurred, for in them was our trust to
carry our camp baggage.
</p>

<p>
From this emporium of teak, I went down to the
docks, where I spent a considerable time. The art of
ship-building has, from boyhood upwards, ever exercised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
a peculiar fascination over me; and only very recently
I designed a five-foot model of a steamer, which I
hope, ere long, to build with that most excellent of antipodean
woods, the cowry pine, the chief characteristics
of which are close grain and elasticity.
</p>

<p>
There were a number of fair sized vessels in different
stages of construction, others in course of repair.
</p>

<p>
Chinamen predominated, as might have been expected,
among the carpenters, and they certainly
appeared to me to take matters remarkably easy. I
neglected to inquire whether they were paid by time
or by work accomplished; if the latter, their earnings
must have been insignificant.
</p>

<p>
What they undertake, however, is done well; though
slow and easy going, they are on occasion painstaking,
accurate and steady.
</p>

<p>
The practice of opium-smoking may induce lethargy,
but not impairment of the faculties as with alcohol.
</p>

<p>
One vessel, which was just receiving the finishing
touches, looked so trim that I was tempted on board,
and her recent history was of a nature to open my eyes
to certain phases of the ways of man, of which I had
previously been totally ignorant.
</p>

<p>
About six weeks before, she had sailed with a large
cargo of timber, but had not proceeded far when she
was <i>discovered</i> to be extremely leaky, and everything
was made ready in case she should founder. On one
occasion indeed the crew took to the boats, but as it
became evident that the buoyancy of her cargo would
keep her afloat, she was again boarded and brought
back for repairs. The individual who took upon himself
to acquaint me with these thrilling facts expressed
such unconcealed disgust at the way in which she had
floated when she <i>ought</i> to have sunk—“She’d a’ been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
worth a load more at the bottom!”—conjured up
visions of a snug insurance, and on reading between the
lines, I found it unnecessary to inquire into the <i>origin</i>
of the leak!
</p>

<p>
Taking leave of my very outspoken companion, I
emerged from the docks a sadder, yet a wiser man, than
I had entered them. Already, in the old days, Shylock
arrived at certain practical conclusions anent “land-rats
and water-rats, and the peril of waters, winds and rocks,”
but such calculated villainy as the above is one of the
fruits of the grand march of civilization.
</p>

<p>
The sight of all others, upon which the good people
of this place above all prided themselves, was that of
the “Caves,” and I firmly believe that my newly-acquired
friends and hospitable entertainers were rather
nettled at my electing to visit the timber-yard and
docks first. But the horizon soon cleared, when my
friend and self arranged to go there on the morrow.
Although not far off, they were difficult of approach at
this season of the year, owing to the intervening expanse
of water that had to be traversed, for the caves were
located in some rocks that stood in the midst of that
element.
</p>

<p>
Our intention evidently pleased our host, for besides
a whole volume of instructions and warnings, every
preparation was made for our comfort, and we started
after breakfast with a hamper large enough for six, an
extra coat apiece, an umbrella and a supply of torches.
A Madrassee Jehu drove us through two or three miles
of country under-timber, until we brought up at the
edge of a swamp. Here occurred a pause of half an
hour, after which a Burmese, who had sallied forth in
quest of his elephant, returned with it.
</p>

<p>
The “howdah” was most ingeniously constructed of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
bamboo and cane, very light and comfortable, as much
so, at least, as anything can be on the back of one of
those animals. Lashing everything securely, we plunged
at once into the wilderness of waters, the margin of
which was surrounded by large trees, creepers, and
undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
Cautious as usual, the animal threaded its way,
bearing direct for the two rocks, which stood out conspicuously
about equidistant from dry land on either
side. The distance looked nothing at starting, though,
measured by the time it took to accomplish, it must
have been considerable. Of course the animal had to
proceed with extreme caution, plumbing the depth with
its fore foot at every step, before trusting so enormous
a weight to an uncertain bottom. In our progress we
perceived numbers of elephants among the trees, from
which they were breaking off suitable branches, first
employing them with their trunks to whisk off numerous
insect tormentors, and afterwards consigning the leafy
morsels to their mouths.
</p>

<p>
As we approached the rocks, the water became
gradually shallower, until we again emerged on dry
land and stood before the mouth of the principal cave.
The entrance was by way of a short passage some ten
feet high, profusely adorned with images of Gautama,
but otherwise unaltered by the hand of man. This
abruptly expanded into a huge, vaulted chamber, damp,
cold and dark as Erebus. Here we donned our extra
coats and lighted the torches. As the flames dispelled
the gloom, a very beautiful sight burst upon us. From
the roof depended enormous masses of stalactites of
every size, over which water trickled, exhibiting prismatic
colours as the torchlight fell upon them at various
angles; and they seemed studded with innumerable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
precious stones of exceeding brilliancy, the gems of
Golconda, rubies from “the mines” and emeralds from
Santa Fé. It was like being suddenly ushered into the
abode of some fairy, the deception being heightened by
the fantastic shapes of the rocks beneath, the result of
the trickling water. Around and about the rocks were
narrow paths covered with a soft substance, which took
the impression of our feet, and though we could distinctly
hear the murmur of flowing water, it was nowhere
visible.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, it suddenly ceased, until we entered cave
number two—like the first in every particular, only
smaller—when it recommenced, puzzling me as much
as before. By the time we had entered the third recess,
it again ceased; and in extreme perplexity I asked
our guide what it meant. The reply was almost as
surprising as the mysterious sound itself—it proceeded
from the wings of countless numbers of bats, fleeing
before the light of our torches. We explored all the
caves; I forget their number now, their beauty—never!
</p>

<p>
That same sound as of running water—really the
gentle flapping of bats’ wings—pioneered our retreat.
I was rather ahead of the others, when my torch
suddenly went out, leaving me in profound darkness.
I tried to grope my way, but a few tumbles over those
by no means soft rocks brought me to a standstill. I
sat, therefore, like Patience on a rock, until my friend
came up with the guide; otherwise, I believe I should
be there now!
</p>

<p>
When we finally quitted the caves the light of the
sun dazzled us so uncommonly, that some moments
passed ere we could regain our normal vision. We at
once sought out the shady side of the rock, and proceeded
to open the hamper. Everything had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
thought of; and as the trip had sharpened our appetites,
the cold fowls and ham soon disappeared, and the
bottles of claret cup leaked alarmingly.
</p>

<p>
The elephant found no difficulty in stowing away all
the bread that was left, while his master was content
with a smoke. And so we chatted on, until the
lengthening shadows of the rock warned us to set out
on our homeward way.
</p>

<p>
That evening our glowing account of the lovely caves,
and genuine praises of the contents of the hamper,
reinstated us in the good opinion of our hostess. This
alone was conducive to a good night’s rest; and a day’s
outing under a sun removed only sixteen and a half
degrees from the Equator, and the lurching and jolting
on the back of a terrestrial leviathan, supplied what was
wanting.
</p>

<p>
I was not sorry, therefore, when the retiring hour
came round, and I could pass straight into dreamland.
</p>

<p>
Caves are exceedingly common in this part of the
country, more especially on the upper reaches of the
river. They are considered, in some measure at least,
sacred by the Burmese, who endeavour to ornament
their entrances with images, flags and other devices;
but what ideas they entertain with regard to their origin
and formation I never remember hearing. These particular
caves were evidently formed in the ordinary
way; by the action, that is, of water and possibly some
chemical action on oolitic limestone. But how this
solitary rock resisted the violent forces in operation
when the principal mass was removed, would require an
expert geologist to explain.
</p>

<p>
Even here, such a doctor might be as much at fault
as his <i>confrères</i> have shown themselves with regard to
those singular detached rocks at Tunbridge Wells, at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
which they have laboured in vain. Their grooved,
fluted bases unquestionably denote the action of violent
currents at some period or other; and being the fittest,
they have survived the general overthrow. And certainly
they have been put to the utmost use as a show
place at that fashionable resort, and much ingenuity
has been expended on making them appear more extensive
than they really are.

<p class="post">
The glory of this place had departed. As Moulmein
rose in importance this once busy centre fell into decay,
assuming for the most part its primeval condition of
luxuriant vegetation.
</p>

<p>
It was, nevertheless, the spot chosen for a sanatorium
during the second Burmese war, and it certainly fulfilled
the requirements of all concerned. Being built on the
seashore, and at the mouth of the river, it combined
great salubrity with easiness of approach.
</p>

<p>
At the extreme point of a ledge of rocks that ran
some distance out to sea stood the lighthouse, from
which a submerged reef stretched obliquely towards the
shore, enclosing an area of water in which the soldiers
used to bathe, although the mouth of the river was
infested with sharks.
</p>

<p>
According to the testimony of the oldest inhabitant,
none of these monsters had ever been known to stray
inside the reef; though how soon this immunity ceased
to be, the reader will learn before the close of the present
chapter.
</p>

<p>
There were several barracks facing the sea, and close
to the shore, which was composed of alternate stretches
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
of sand and rock. They were built on piles, very roomy
and comfortable, having thick roofs and broad verandahs;
and although unoccupied for several years, they
were soon rendered habitable by a little vigorous sweeping
and scrubbing, the eviction of extensive colonies of
bats, spiders, and other insects, which were in possession,
and had multiplied after their kind.
</p>

<p>
Amherst was, in fact, to Moulmein much what Brighton
is to the Metropolis—a convenient place to run down to
for a brief respite from drudgery and a breath of sea
air.
</p>

<p>
The only particular, however, in which it could compete
with the “Queen of Watering-places” was the
absolute perfect rest which it afforded, and which is the
only commodity that England cannot supply. No; our
island is <i>facile princeps</i> a land of unrest, and is becoming
more so day by day. Not more than five years ago I
lighted on a primitive seaside place, where one could be
free as air and, if so minded, wear out all one’s old
clothes. But, lo and behold! the ubiquitous builder
scented it from afar, and now it is simply—ruined! A
pier now desecrates its hitherto pure waters, round the
bulbous extremity of which lounges the gorgeous
Cockney, listening to indifferent music, and tainting the
air with cigars that must have been home-made! Ere
long there will be Ethiopians, winkle sellers, and photographers
to fright the place from its propriety.
</p>

<p>
Amherst was just the reverse of this, and charming
in its naked simplicity.
</p>

<p>
My friend and self decided on spending two or three
days there, partly because we thought that a sea bathe
would brace us up, and partly for the sake of tasting a
certain small fish which abounds only in this neighbourhood,
and which is so delicate as to spoil in transit, even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
so short a distance as that to Moulmein, ice being in
those days an unknown luxury in remote Eastern
stations.
</p>

<p>
The praises of this wonderful fish had been sung to
us so often that, even with me, simple as my tastes are
as to what I should “eat, drink, and avoid,” the anticipation
of its flavour alternated with impatience to bathe
once more in the blue sea; while I do not think I am
doing an injustice to the memory of my dear old friend
when I say that with him the fish preponderated,
the bathe being but as skim milk compared to the
cream.
</p>

<p>
People at home would be extremely “put about”
if, whenever they intended spending a few days at
Brighton, they had to send on ahead beds and bedding,
furniture, crockery, etc.; and if such were necessary, the
place would probably welcome fewer visitors.
</p>

<p>
Yet this is what any lover of whitebait would have to
do when bent on visiting the Burmese Greenwich. In
the East, however, your factotum saves you all the
trouble; you have but to tell him where you are going
and how long you intend to stay, and, with a quickness
acquired by long practice, he grasps the situation
and forgets nothing.
</p>

<p>
In this case, especial stress was laid on the absolute
necessity of procuring <i>the</i> fish for dinner, to which end
he started the day before, thus making assurance doubly
sure.
</p>

<p>
Failing therein, heavy penalties were darkly hinted
at, to which he listened without moving a muscle,
salaam’d, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The following afternoon we were borne quickly down
stream in a roomy boat, provided with an awning astern.
The conversation had reference to the Mutiny and all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
that we had seen since; but ever and anon the “fish”
would crop up, showing what was uppermost in our
minds.
</p>

<p>
When we landed at our destination there was still
some little daylight before us, so we resolved on a preliminary
tour of inspection, first of our quarters, and
then of the shore.
</p>

<p>
The former we found in a very satisfactory condition;
the latter was composed of hard sand, pleasant to walk
on, while large rocks abutted into the sea covered with
seaweeds and a variety of molluscs and crustaceans,
especially small oysters. The scene brought vividly to
the fore days now numbered with the past and oft
looked back upon; but as darkness was coming on
apace, as is its wont in the tropics, we retraced our
steps, guided by the light that streamed from our room
through the venetian blinds.
</p>

<p>
The supreme moment was now near at hand. We
had scarcely performed our ablutions and made some
slight change in our dress, when my friend gave the
order for dinner, in a voice which might have been heard
half way up to Moulmein, and, with customary punctuality,
our domestic announced it almost immediately
with an air of intense satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
It was a trying moment: there stood the dish, beneath
the cover of which peeped out a snow-white
napkin. My friend helped both of us liberally, and the
attack commenced. After a few mouthfuls we looked
up and our eyes met; on both our faces stood mute
disappointment. We neither thought anything of the
fish, and we confessed as much.
</p>

<p>
It was certainly aggravating. Day after day our
friends had instilled into the porches of our ears the
exquisite delicacy of a fish to be met with nowhere else,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
and we might just as well have masticated a few lumps
of gelatine!
</p>

<p>
I did my best to dispel my friend’s gloomy looks by
perpetrating a few mild jokes, the effect of which was,
strangely enough, not beneficial or soothing; and it was
not before dinner was nearly over, and the claret had
made several journeys, that his drooping spirits revived
and the storm burst. He consigned the unhappy fish to—well,
not back into their native element, at any rate.
As soon as we had adjourned to the verandah to smoke
the pipe of peace he fell asleep, and I was left to my
own meditations. I might have followed his example,
but for an impudent mosquito that buzzed round me
sufficiently to keep me awake; he was evidently in
quest of a meal, and I shrewdly suspect he got one, for
I soon fell into a reverie. Just a zephyr coming seaward
wafted to my corner the smell of the sea, fragrant
as “the sweet south upon a bed of violets.” The happy
frame of mind it produced was very similar to what I had
experienced off Madeira, the few extra degrees of temperature
being differentiated by my light clothing. The
waves, shimmering in the fitful moonlight, rolled in
steady succession over the sandy shore, and again
returned to the mass of waters.
</p>

<p>
My thoughts winged their way back to a primitive
seaside place on the Welsh coast, where I had often
gazed out upon such a scene as this, though listening to
the dulcet accents of a siren, instead of being roused
ever and anon by a snore louder than usual, which in so
far resembled the murmur of the wild waves, in that
every seventh was of greater dimensions than those that
had gone before.
</p>

<p>
More vivid grew the vision; we were now leaning
hand in hand over the balustrade, when, suddenly, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
lissom figure by my side seemed to fall into the water,
and I actually started up from my chair in agony.
</p>

<p>
That broke the spell; my friend awoke with a grunt,
and asked what the time was. I told him it was already
2 a.m., and that we must be getting to bed; but, being
sleepy and supremely comfortable, he “would not let
belief take hold of him.” Argument being of no avail,
more energetic measures had to be employed, and I at
last succeeded in getting him indoors, when, with mutual
vows to be up early for a bathe, we turned in and fell
asleep.
</p>

<p>
All the residents with whom we had spoken on the
subject were agreed that bathing was perfectly safe
within the triangular area of water bounded by the
visible ledge of rocks leading to the lighthouse and the
sunken reef that joined it, at an angle, with the shore.
</p>

<p>
Soldiers had bathed there times without number;
though a hand dangled in the water outside the reef
would have been snapped off in a trice. Provided,
therefore, with towels, we were soon stripped, placing
our clothes well beyond the reach of the flowing tide.
There being, moreover, no audience but the sea-birds,
who were in this place scarcely more untrammelled
by conventionalities than ourselves, we dispensed with
bathing-drawers, which are, however, used in India in
deference to the prejudices of the natives, who consider
it an indecent habit to dispense with them. More impatient
than my companion, I was the first to traverse
the intervening strip of sand and throw myself into the
water. Rising again, I began to swim parallel with the
shore, when I saw my friend, who was on the point of
following, stop short, while he called out, “Come in
as fast as you can!” Fully comprehending what his
eyes were fixed on, I made for the shore with all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
strength I could muster, crying out to him to throw
in the largest stones he could lay hands on.
</p>

<p>
I knew that he had seen the back fin of a shark,
aroused doubtless by my splash to the expectation of
a meal. It makes me shudder even now, when I think
of that moment.
</p>

<p>
Fast as I could swim on the wings—or fins—of fear,
it was at best but crawling compared to the dart of the
fish, which presently laid hold of my ankle, his serrated
teeth cutting to the bone like a razor. I thought I was
in my depth and endeavoured to touch the bottom, and
sank. The shark had instantly relinquished his hold,
but I fully expected another attack, though I managed
to reach the shore without further molestation, for the
creature was darting on all sides, confused by the pieces
of rock which my friend continued flinging at him with
unflagging energy.
</p>

<p>
In great pain and rather faint from loss of blood, I
scrambled on to the sand and lay down exhausted. On
coming round, I found my foot tightly bandaged, and
my doctor-friend standing over me.
</p>

<p>
He presently helped me up to the rock, where we
slowly dressed ourselves and had a chat about my
narrow escape. One precaution of his was characteristic;
and that was avoiding the mention of the
terrible object he had seen when he gave me the alarm,
from fear that the shock might incapacitate me.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of a shark in this hitherto safe expanse
of water is easily to be accounted for by ingress
during an abnormally high tide, and inability to get
back over the reef after the sea had sunk to its ordinary
level.
</p>

<p>
More unintelligible was the brute’s failure to nip off
so much as a foot; and I can only hazard a theory in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
explanation, that he must have come at me at right
angles instead of straight on end.
</p>

<p>
There are moments in the lives of all of us which
simply defy description. This was one of them. When
the Sepoys fired and the commanding officer fell dead
in my arms, was another! Meeting that tiger when
out shooting was a third; and a fourth occurred years
afterwards in India, when a tigress chased my pony for
upwards of a mile.
</p>

<p>
All were bad enough, but this was perhaps the worst;
for all was fair above, while the terrible danger lurked
beneath.
</p>

<p>
With my foot well bound up, I managed to accept
my friend’s support to our quarters. Had there been
at hand any means for so doing, I should have set up
a notice-board opposite the spot, warning intending
bathers somewhat after the manner of the Apostolic
injunction:—“Beware of——sharks!”
</p>

<p>
But we had to be content with impressing on Europeans
and natives alike the necessity of cautioning
venturesome visitors.
</p>

<p>
It was the second grave disappointment in the brief
span of twelve hours!
</p>

<p>
And I fear the sense of thankfulness was ephemeral,
and the grumbling of far longer duration. It did seem
<i>not</i> quite on a par with the fitness of things that such
smooth, tempting, blue water should henceforth be forbidden,
and that the principal object of our visit, sea-bathing,
should at the outset be nipped in the bud in
such an unmistakable manner. But though it sparkled
in the rays of the sun, with its bosom quietly heaving
in a midday siesta, “noli me tangere” was in our eyes
written on its unruffled surface as indelibly as on that
fabled tree, whose golden fruit tasted exceeding bitter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We had to confine our attention to things terrestrial;
and many a time as we walked among the rocks examining
the creatures which adhered to them, a feeling
of anger would come over me, and in my peevish
opposition to the decrees of Providence, I would fling
stones into the water in childlike resentment. What
feeble puny creatures we men are! Once the spring of
anger is allowed to well up, and the desire for retaliation
comes to the surface, there is no limit to the petty
acts to which we will descend!
</p>

<p>
In those unrighteous moments, I considered not the
instincts implanted in the creature; and was moreover
thoroughly ungrateful for having emerged from a ghastly
fate by the skin of my foot. I furthermore devised a plan
for capturing the <i>fons et origo</i> (syntax!); but the necessary
gear was not forthcoming, nor could I derive any assistance
from the native fishermen, who have an invincible
dread of the creature, having learnt from experience
not to meddle with it. Besides the undeniable satisfaction
of landing and despatching him, his armoury of
teeth would have been well worth preserving, and a
portion of the spine would have made a valuable walking-stick.
</p>

<p>
It is strange that sharks do not frequent the harbour
at Aden; the more so, as they swarm just outside its
mouth. As soon as a steamer drops anchor there, she
is surrounded by numbers of little Arab boys, amphibious
brats and experts at diving, who clamour for coins
to be thrown overboard, which they at once retrieve with
amazing dexterity. So nice is their sense of touch
under water, that they can at once discriminate between
a coin of the realm and a piece of tin cut the exact size.
I have often tried the deception, and the diver invariably
came to the surface uttering unmistakable exclamations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
of disgust. The absence of sharks may be
accepted as fact, since I never heard of an accident
happening to any of these children. Yet boats were
constantly coming in with several small sharks on board,
taken in the nets, which readily sold for native consumption.
</p>

<p>
The environs of Amherst proved unsatisfactory,
especially as dangerous snakes abounded in the rank
undergrowth that had almost obliterated what had once
been roads and footpaths.
</p>

<p>
Everything told of decay: there were a few <i>Amherstias</i>
being slowly killed by parasitic creepers, just
as ivy or honeysuckle will sap the vitality of our trees
at home.
</p>

<p>
I remember, too, the remains of a once prosperous
sugar-factory, the walls of which had been forced asunder
by vegetation, which was fast reclaiming the land. The
only other points of interest were some enormous
samples of sugar-cane, the largest examples of the
saccharine bamboo that I had ever beheld.
</p>

<p>
Thankful at being able to return in company, and
still smarting from our twofold disappointment, we re-ascended
the river at a slow pace. Nevertheless the
change had done us a deal of good.

CHAPTER XVII.
<br />
TAVOY.
</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
“Like a dull actor now, I have forgot my part.”
</p>
</div>

<p class="post">
The somewhat tedious journey up the river was to an
extent beguiled by a review of our recent experiences,
which, if not unique, were by no means commonplace.
My friend, taking up the parable, contrasted our present
position with what might have been, if he had perforce
returned alone.
</p>

<p>
He made one of the longest speeches I ever heard
from him, which for obvious reasons I shall not reproduce;
remarking, <i>inter alia</i>, that he would not have had
the courage to face the others without me, and making
an unwarrantable pun about the bruising of my sole!
</p>

<p>
As originally arranged, the time of my departure was
now drawing nigh. In two days more the steamer that
had brought us would take me back, and I should make
a fresh start from the “whited sepulchre,” only in the
reverse direction.
</p>

<p>
Once again my plans were altered. Sitting on a
jetty one evening we saw the “mail” boat let go her
anchor just opposite us. As all letters were to remain
with my agents until my return, I had nothing to look
forward to; and I therefore proposed that we should go
on board and hear the news. We therefore hailed a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
boat, and were soon in the midst of all the commotion
of letting off steam, orders and counter-orders. My
friend found an old acquaintance in the captain, and
while they were talking I drew aside to watch the busy
scene that was being enacted.
</p>

<p>
I was then introduced to Captain B., who, after the
customary observations, said: “Our mutual friend has
informed me of the dilemma in which you were placed
by the breaking down of the Straits boat. I am off
with the mail to-morrow to Tavoy and Mergui, and if
you will give me the pleasure of your company, I’ll
make you as comfortable as I can.” I accepted the
invitation without more ado, merely suggesting that I
thought it would be more reasonable if I were permitted
to—, but he interrupted me, insisting that I should
come as his guest, or not at all.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of the English mail with letters and
newspapers six weeks old, always creates a flutter
among Europeans in the East, everyone waiting impatiently
for his own budget. In the arrangements
even of the “Post” the ways of the East are exactly
opposite to those of the West, for, instead of having the
letters, etc., delivered, we send a trusty man for them.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was just over when that worthy arrived with
a goodly load, the contents of which soon found their
way into the hands of their respective owners. I
was left out in the cold, and would have given a trifle
for certain communications; nevertheless, under the
circumstances of my original arrangements, it would
have been mere folly to have had them sent from pillar
to post all round the Bay of Bengal with a great risk
of losing them. A friend handed me a newspaper, and
on opening it, almost the first news I saw was the death
of a very dear member of the family. I was aboard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
the <i>Pluto</i>, with my small belongings early next morning,
and had not long to wait ere we got under weigh
and steamed down the river. She was a beautiful
boat, built on graceful lines, combining speed with
beam, and well armed, and employed by Government
for every available purpose during peace and
war; but she seemed “a cut above” carrying mails and
stores.
</p>

<p>
In his desire to make me comfortable the skipper
attempted to give up his own cabin, but I rebelled at
this, and warned him against spoiling me at the outset.
I reminded him, moreover, that I had grown accustomed
to adversity in the East, and had probably many
a stony path before me, and to give me a bed of roses to
lie upon now would but make me feel the thorns more
keenly afterwards. My arguments prevailed, and he
contented himself with giving me the free run of the
ship.
</p>

<p>
Rounding the lighthouse, our course lay to the southward,
parallel to the land, which I do not think we ever
lost sight of. Verdure-clad hills skirted the shore,
while here and there a pagoda glistening in the sun
betokened the proximity of an isolated village. The
country was known to be sparsely populated, and in
such places only where a river debouched on the sea.
Of actual life we saw none; no boats, nor man, nor
beast.
</p>

<p>
The changing scene was delightful, and I did not for
a moment regret having accepted the invitation on the
spur of the moment. Years of experience have shown
me that such decisions turn out, as a rule, better than
those arrived at after the process we are pleased to call
deliberation. We are told to “look before we leap.”
<i>Cui bono?</i> when none of us can see a hair’s breadth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
into the future. Moreover, thinking over anything
generally confuses nine men out of every ten, and the
judgment of man, in whatsoever direction he may exercise
it, almost invariably arrives at an erroneous decision.
No; as far as my individual experience goes, instinct,
viewed in the light of subsequent events, has throughout
been safer than reasoning, while I regret not having
acted on first impressions on several memorable and
critical occasions.
</p>

<p>
We continued our southward course for a time, when
the ship’s head was suddenly turned due east, and we
were evidently making for a river. For some time
I could distinguish no opening, having but a landsman’s
powers of observation; but at length a fissure appeared
in the otherwise unbroken line of mangrove forest which
marks this coast, and ere long we were in the river that
flows past Tavoy. I at once noticed that it was very
much narrower than the Salween, more muddy, and
also more rapid, cutting its way through the web of
mangroves, that alone prevented the earth silting up
the river and forming the usual bar at its mouth.
</p>

<p>
I may, <i>en passant</i>, mention a peculiarity of the seeds
of this plant; and that is, they enjoy the power of
germinating while still attached to the tree; the radicle,
bursting through the covering, imbeds itself in the mud,
and is followed in due course by the seed.
</p>

<p>
Some species of mangroves are sweet and palatable, and
the wood of some of them is hard enough to be in
demand for a variety of purposes, while others are rich
in an inferior quality of tannin.
</p>

<p>
The generality of rivers are characterized by the
graceful curves described by their winding course; but
this one formed an exception, indulging in an eccentric
abruptness, depending, of course, on the lay of the land.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At one time it looked as if we were running right on
to the bank; and I was expecting to hear the familiar
“Let go the anchor!” when I noticed that the river
turned sharp round to the nor’ard. Still we kept our
course, until the bowsprit was right over the low, open
land! I was on the bridge at the time, but I did not
dare say a word to the captain, whose energies were
concentrated on this trying and hazardous piece of
navigation. I was clutching at the railing, almost
unable to endure the suspense a moment longer, when
suddenly the helm was altered, the bowsprit described
an arc of 90°, and we were steaming up a deep channel
parallel with the shore.
</p>

<p>
I could not help congratulating the captain on this
masterly piece of steering; and he acknowledged that
he always turned his back on the river with relief, as
it was the worst he had to navigate in any of his
voyages.
</p>

<p>
Tavoy was one of those small stations dotted about
the Tenasserim provinces, which we held with a handful
of men, so as to prevent any awkward mistake as to the
actual ownership of the country. It was now occupied
by part of a Madras regiment. As evening was descending
upon the scene, I saw but little of the native
town, and still less of the military quarters, which were
so nestled among the trees as to be for the most part
undistinguishable. At the best it must have been a
very dreary, isolated spot, shut out from the rest of the
world, and offering officers and men the dubious delights
of penal servitude. It doubtless resembled Pegu in one
particular, the facilities afforded for saving money,
besides which it must, in the dry season, have been a
veritable El Dorado to the sportsman. But then it is
not everyone in whom dwells the spirit to go forth and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
shoot! In the days, too, of which I am writing, men
were sent out to the East at sixteen or seventeen years
of age, and rarely acquired a musical or scientific turn,
so their resources in such a place were indeed limited.
The educational structure was built on the primitive
model; classics and mathematics were regarded as its
foundation, plinth, superstructure, and roof; history,
geography, and a smattering of French, were embellishments,
and music, drawing, and science, would do
at any time!
</p>

<p>
Here, as elsewhere, the twelve mail days in the year
were looked forward to with longing, and their dates
written up in letters of gold. One mail every month!
The present generation cannot comprehend such a state
of affairs; neither could we understand the conditions
obtaining in Hindustan under Clive.
</p>

<p>
And yet in this matter, having to wait thirty days
for each batch of news, the wind was, to some extent,
tempered to the shorn lamb, for we had not yet arrived
at the high-pressure age. Not only did the events of a
year occupy less space and importance than do those of
a month nowadays, but before the spread of steam and
electricity half the events actually enacted never came
to light.
</p>

<p>
Now, on a declaration of war being ventured, millions
are brought into the field, in lieu of thousands, and
campaigns that formerly occupied years are (now) a
matter of weeks. A Revolution breaks out, and the
entire order of Government is reversed in four and
twenty hours. Accidents by sea and land are alarming
in their frequency, and appalling in their magnitude;
murders, committed on the slightest provocation, are
known in our furthest possessions almost ere the victims
are cold, and are served up in various ways by a sensational
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
press. One by one, too, the various grades of
the working classes are quarrelling with their bread and
butter, set on by agitators, who eat the grain, leaving
their sheep the husks.
</p>

<p>
Endless divorce cases, from the lowest rung to the
top of the ladder, fraught with momentous and unlooked-for
consequences, disfigure every newspaper. Speculation,
which seems to have reached its furthest limits in
every direction, is producing commercial panics; and
on every side our affairs are trembling in the balance.
Garbage is plentiful, and sensational events so unintermittent
that it is surprising how editors still find the
need of drawing on their inventive faculties!
</p>

<p>
If Tavoy existed at the present day under the old
<i>régime</i>, few Europeans would survive the ordeal beyond
a mail or two.
</p>

<p>
The captain was evidently not enamoured of the
place; he took time by the “fetlock,” landed the mails
and cargo, and made everything ready to be off early
next morning. As soon as sufficient light dawned upon
us we backed to that “unriver-like” bend, and were
soon out at sea again. Of all the places I ever stopped
at, Tavoy remains enveloped in the most impenetrable
haze, so far as my recollection of it is concerned. Times
without number I have tried to conjure it up in detail;
but beyond fragments of buildings, a dense mass of
vegetation, and a few natives, I can make nothing of it.
I fear, therefore, that the heading of this chapter may
be taken as somewhat misleading; it will serve, however,
as a halting-place, before the more interesting
portion of the trip, with which I shall take leave of the
reader.
</p>

<p>
What I do remember of the place is being struck with
the fact that none of the officers came on board, whereas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
the rule is for them to come off in anything that will
float as soon as the anchor is let go.
</p>

<p>
They resided but a short distance from the jetty,
alongside which we were anchored; and it was therefore
all the more curious that they should be conspicuous by
their absence. Perhaps they did not care for such
ephemeral excitement; what after all was a steamer
to them as long as she landed the mail and mess-stores?
Perhaps, too, the ordeal was too much for
them; I myself knew the envy and misery attendant
on seeing off a friend “homeward bound;” straining
one’s eyes after the ship that drops slowly down to the
sea, and then returning to purgatory!
</p>

<p>
It is almost as bad as leaving home afresh, without
the mitigating pleasures of anticipation.
</p>

<p>
Tavoy, as a whole, apart from any individual
characteristics which may have distinguished its town,
certainly struck me as a spot where those native to the
place and “to the manner born,” might lead a very
peaceful existence. Nature had placed within their
reach a supply of delicious food, to be had without the
asking. The bright green leaves of the plantain rose up
in every direction, growing and multiplying unaided,
besides bearing huge clusters of fruit all the year
round. The glossy, thick-leaved Jack-fruit was also
conspicuous; palms reared their tufted heads aloft,
among them the much esteemed cocoa-nut, useful in
more ways than one; there, too, the leafy tamarind
stood waving its pinnate foliage in the evening breeze,
proof against the scorching rays of the sun, even at
midday.
</p>

<p>
The women, as elsewhere, sat under their houses,
busy with the looms, on which they spun garments of
many colours and gorgeous design. The buffaloes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
grazed around, enjoying a peaceful existence, until
summoned to the periodical contest in the arena.
They found no lack of food, and were kept at night
in a strong enclosure, secure from the prowling tiger.
</p>

<p>
Rice and tobacco were the principal articles under
cultivation, requiring little trouble and insignificant
outlay of capital.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the aborigines must have led a happy, contented
life in such a place; while the European grumbled,
growled, and vilified everything, after the manner of his
kind.

CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />
THE MERGUI ARCHIPELAGO.
</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“Alone she sat—alone! that worn-out word,</p>
<p>So idly spoken and so coldly heard;</p>
<p>Yet all the poets sing, and grief hath known,</p>
<p>Of hope laid waste, knells in that word—alone!”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
Anyone glancing at a map of the world’s two hemispheres,
cannot fail to notice that all the continents end
in more or less pointed extremities looking due south,
and that most of the larger islands, showing length in
lieu of breadth, also lie nearly due north and south.
The first half of the above remark is pointed by such
examples as South America, Africa, India, and the prolongation
from China in the direction now under notice;
while the latter finds expression in the larger islands of
the West India group; also in Sumatra, Java, Flores,
Timor, New Guinea, and many others. Any attempt
at an explanation of this curious symmetry in the conformation
of our earth would be more appropriate to a
manual of geography; and as it would involve the
balancing of the many theories in favour of a local or
universal deluge, I shall not enter into it.
</p>

<p>
The islands of the archipelago we were now approaching
partook much of the same character. After a run
of three hundred miles we came to them, a group keeping
remarkably equidistant from the mainland, as far as
Wellesley in the Malay Peninsula. Exceedingly beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
and tempting they looked, as we passed each in
turn; all well wooded, their shores composed, as the
mainland, of sand and rock, but the only signs of life
came from a few birds flitting about the trees, and a
stray turtle basking on the shore. Man had not set his
mark on the place.
</p>

<p>
As the steamer could not put us ashore we had to
satisfy our curiosity by the aid of the glass. One island,
the largest we had yet passed, was, so the captain told
me, associated with that historical period when the
French and ourselves were still trying conclusions as
to which power was to be predominant in the East.
</p>

<p>
An opening in the side facing the mainland led to a
sort of basin in the interior of the island, a natural dock,
which the French found very handy for their vessels
under repairs. The British fleet was then in pursuit of
them, and probably passed in sight of this identical
island, never dreaming of the snug retreat within. Otherwise,
it had gone badly with the French, who would have
been caught in a trap; for a single British vessel would
have sufficed to guard the entrance, until the enemy
capitulated.
</p>

<p>
As we surveyed each island in turn, striving in vain
to distinguish some signs of higher animal life, and
wondering why such beautiful spots should continue
uninhabited, my thoughts wandered into the region of
fancy, and pictured many things.
</p>

<p>
So strong in me was the desire of leading a Robinson
Crusoe kind of existence on one of them, that I must
have given my thoughts audible expression, for I heard
a voice beside me, “No, you wouldn’t; and if you did
you’d be sorry for it!” I saw that the speaker was a
merchant, the owner of a coasting vessel; and as he
refused to explain his interruption, I might have considered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
it an impertinence on his part, but that his face
betrayed unwonted sadness. For two days he made no
further allusion to the subject, and I was left to speculate
upon the probable cause of his emotion; someone
he loved, perhaps, fell overboard opposite that identical
island into the jaws of a ravenous shark. Or maybe, a
quarrel arose among his Lascars, who forthwith ran
amuck, staining his decks with blood, and branding his
good ship with an evil reputation.
</p>

<p>
Or, if both these conjectures were erroneous, he may
have been driven ashore through carelessness or a
storm, suffering thereby pecuniary loss as well as
bodily injury.
</p>

<p>
As usual, my speculations were all at fault. One
evening after dinner, my fellow-passenger told me his
tale; and as it will serve as a warning to those of my
readers who are given to dwelling in airy castles, besides
affording a more specific description of the general
characteristics of these islands than my own personal
experience would enable me to give, I make no apology
for reproducing it, while we are still in sight of the
archipelago.
</p>

<p>
He was, as I have already mentioned, a trader, the
owner of a sailing-vessel, in which he conveyed merchandise
between the various ports along the coast. It
was an independent and profitable method of doing
business, and his Lascars were all hard-working, steady
men.
</p>

<p>
Sailing to and fro past these islands, the idea of
residing on one of them for a time, Crusoe fashion, grew
upon him with such force, that it finally became irresistible.
</p>

<p>
The first move in the wrong direction was landing,
and roaming about the island—the identical one that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
had attracted my attention two days previously—with
one of his men.
</p>

<p>
Not content, however, he constructed a temporary
abode on the side facing the mainland, which was fitted
up in a rude way with some of the ship’s furniture; and
as nothing ever passed on that side of the island, save
the mail steamer and his own vessel, he left everything
there in perfect security, his mind occupied in thinking
of the various essential articles which had to be taken
out on successive trips, and eagerly looking forward to
the time when he should take up his abode there.
</p>

<p>
At length, everything was ready, and he determined
to try the experiment during the next voyage to
Moulmein. His men, with the customary politeness of
natives in respect of the actions of any European, forbore
from questioning his intentions, which they may
have guessed to some extent, though certainly not <i>in
toto</i>.
</p>

<p>
It only remained to send for his head man, explain
the state of affairs to him, and hand over the
care of the ship. That worthy received the charge
without a word of surprise or remonstrance; and,
although he knew that he was about to commit
a rash act, and would have given worlds to retract,
he now felt that having shared his plans with a
subordinate, he must go through with them at any
cost.
</p>

<p>
It was his last night on board. He tossed about in
his cabin, picturing to himself all manner of evils and
unknown dangers, till thoughts became dreams, and he
enjoyed a troubled sleep.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, however, Aurora’s harbinger dispelled
his gloomy fears; and he was more firmly wedded to his
purpose than ever.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was a good deal of whispering among the men,
until one of them, acting as spokesman, endeavoured
with native eloquence to dissuade him from his ill-advised
purpose; but he threw away this last golden
opportunity of retiring gracefully from a most awkward
position, and was duly landed with a gun and some
ammunition, together with such creature comforts as
the occasion demanded.
</p>

<p>
After carrying the things up to the hut, the men
salaam’d and returned to the ship, which soon sailed out
of sight.
</p>

<p>
Then for the first time did he realize the significance
of the word “solitude”: the very voice of nature seemed
hushed, and an unearthly silence pervaded the entire
scene. Returning to the hut, he lit a lamp and sank
into an easy-chair with his gun close at hand. Here he
slept for some time, being visited by the most fanciful
dreams, and was at length startled into consciousness by
the falling of his shot-belt.
</p>

<p>
When he awoke, his usual supper hour was long past;
but unable to eat anything, he uncorked a bottle of
beer, and the noise seemed terrific in the midst of that
deathlike silence—everything frightened him, the cry of
a bird, the moaning of a larger wave than usual on the
shore.
</p>

<p>
Next morning he busied himself about the hut,
and tried fishing; but he could not settle down to
any occupation. Above all, he dreaded the lonely
evening and the wakeful night. He had food in
variety and abundance, but the desire to eat was in
abeyance. Another night of nervous anxiety: he
kept his door securely fastened, although he knew
that nothing was there to enter, even had it been left
wide open.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
</p>

<p>
His fears now took the form of savages visiting the
island to feast, perchance, on prisoners captured in some
recent encounter.
</p>

<p>
On the third night, he managed to fortify the hut in
some measure; loaded both his guns, and saw to his
revolver, which lay under his pillow, and which he
grasped many times during the night, as his disordered
imagination conjured up some visionary danger.
</p>

<p>
The fourth day, he awoke with the same ideas uppermost
in his mind, opened the door of his hut cautiously
and stole out on to the shore.
</p>

<p>
In vain he looked all ways for a sail, half expecting
to see a canoe full of savages down by the beach. Standing
on a lofty ledge of rock and looking down into the
clear, deep water, he watched the fish darting to and fro;
and a horrible propensity to throw himself in and end
his troubles in the bowels of a shark rushed upon him.
It was but ephemeral; yet he turned his back on the sea,
for fear lest it should grow upon him.
</p>

<p>
The desire often came upon him to shout; but weighed
down by the silence of his surroundings, he dared not
even speak aloud.
</p>

<p>
But the consciousness of self-control in having resisted
that fearful temptation had a good effect upon him, for
he soon entered on a more peaceful and contented frame
of mind.
</p>

<p>
One day, he bethought him of another attempt at
fishing, and he managed with a couple of handlines to
catch numbers of the unsuspecting fish, when suddenly
he saw the back fin of a shark. Either the shock caused
by this unwelcome sight, or a tug more violent than
usual caused him to lose his footing on the slippery
rock, and he fell into the water. Strange coincidence!
to have almost succumbed by accident to the fate he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
nearly courted by design! Half a dozen strokes placed
him out of danger; and when he looked round there was
the shark darting about in the very place, attracted no
doubt by the commotion. Never again would he try
fishing on that island.
</p>

<p>
He returned to the hut and changed his wet clothes;
and on revisiting the spot the same afternoon, found
several sharks there, all seeking the cause of the splash,
hoping against hope that their diligence might be rewarded.
</p>

<p>
His attention was next directed to that interesting
amphibian that visited the shore at this season for the
purpose of depositing its eggs in the sand—the turtle.
</p>

<p>
He turned one and despatched it for the table; then
following its footprints away from the sea, he came
upon its eggs, pretty, waxy-looking specimens, and very
good eating when properly baked. The turtle found in
these parts doubtless belonged to the ordinary edible
species, the <i>Chelonia virgata</i>; a variety lacking the
green fat found in those peculiar to the West Indies,
and therefore beneath the notice of an alderman.
</p>

<p>
At last, after many days of watching and weariness,
during which he was utterly weakened in body and
mind, this voluntary Crusoe espied a sail on the far
horizon over towards Moulmein. Nearer and nearer it
came, until he lit a huge bonfire of dry leaves and fired
off several charges from his gun.
</p>

<p>
All this was unnecessary, for it was his own ship
coming back for him. The joy of the meeting between
master and men was mutual. It seemed ages since he
had heard the sound of a human voice; and, surrounded
by his trustworthy Lascars, he made his first hearty
meal under that roof.
</p>

<p>
And the last; for after a stroll round the island,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
during which he showed the men the rock from which
he had fallen, they carried the chattels back to the
ship and quitted the island for good and all.
</p>

<p>
His men—faithful souls—unable to bear the suspense
any longer, had turned back for him, at the risk of incurring
his displeasure, before they had got half way to
Moulmein.
</p>

<p>
Such was the burden of his narrative, which occupied
nearly two hours, so that it was late ere we turned in.
Sounds issuing from the captain’s cabin proved unmistakably
that he was in the Land of Nod; and I soon
joined in the melody, dreaming all manner of things
connected with an island, a kind of “dream within a
dream.”
</p>

<p>
The captain asked me next morning what had kept
us conversing up to so late an hour of the night, so that
I shrewdly suspect the hum of our voices disturbed the
first part of his rest.
</p>

<p>
I had, however, promised my fellow-passenger not to
make any further allusion to the subject of his story
within his hearing, so the captain had to be content
with a promise that I would entertain him therewith as
soon as Mr. —— had left the ship.

CHAPTER XIX.
<br />
MERGUI.
</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“It gives me wonder, great as my content,</p>
<p>To see you here before me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">“Whether we shall meet again, I know not,</p>
<p>Therefore our everlasting farewell take!”</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="post">
The anchorage off Mergui is guarded by an almost
perpendicular rock, which in our case necessitated
steering a point to starboard. Although destitute of
even a blade of grass, this rock is extremely valuable on
account of a certain species of swallow, thousands of
which nest there year after year, their dwellings being
the much prized edible nests, in such great demand
among Chinese epicures, as a stock for their soups.
They resemble those of our own species, though a trifle
more elongated; and are composed of a peculiar kind
of gelatinous seaweed, very palatable when boiled with
the addition of a little mixed spice.
</p>

<p>
When the young ones are fledged, the nests are separated
from the rock, to which they were attached by a
secretion peculiar to the bird.
</p>

<p>
Soup flavoured with these nests is to the Chinese
gourmand what green turtle is to the alderman. Both
are expensive; I never had the courage to ascertain the
price of <i>real</i> turtle, but I know that the nests fetch as
much as <i>£</i>7 per pound, or, as each weighs about half an
ounce, nearly 5<i>s.</i> apiece.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And thus it comes about that this otherwise valueless
rock rents for one thousand rupees per annum; and a
junk annually sails for China with its precious freight.
</p>

<p>
We had to keep clear of the rock, so that I had on
that occasion no chance of examining the birds individually.
They are little more than four inches in
length, while their expanse of wing is nearly three times
as much; on the back they are dark brown, which
passes to lighter shades underneath. In ornithological
parlance they have been christened <i>Collocatia Esculenta</i>.
The fact that they are not scared away from the place
by the men and boys employed in appropriating their
nests, is presumably due to the abstinence of the natives
in holding their hand until the young are on the
wing.
</p>

<p>
Not long after passing the rock, we anchored opposite
the military station of Mergui, now all alive with excitement.
The smoke of the steamer had been seen
from afar, and the residents were aware that it brought
news—good to some, bad to others—from the dear ones
at home.
</p>

<p>
The scene, as we let go the anchor, was striking in
the extreme, and transferred to canvas would have
found favour in the eyes of the most critical scenic
painter of the modern school. In the foreground,
the afore-mentioned rock, rising sheer out of the
cerulean blue, that sent back the rays of an almost perpendicular
sun, while a large opening through the rock
resembled an irregular archway. The station of Mergui
on elevated ground close to the sea, and backed by a
primeval forest, was on the left; while to the right, the
emerald isles dotted the sea southward.
</p>

<p>
Although we arrived somewhat early in the afternoon,
certain adventurous spirits came off at once, protected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
with pith hats and Burmese umbrellas, and were on
deck as soon as the anchor held and the gangway had
been lowered.
</p>

<p>
Very different from their apathetic brother officers
at Tavoy, they came off in quick succession; the
captain was besieged, and bore the ordeal bravely
as usual, with a kind word for everyone, though discriminating
withal. They buzzed round him like bees,
after the manner of mankind in general, where the
nectar is mostly stored, though thirsting in this case for
news.
</p>

<p>
Withdrawing from the group, I looked over the stern
into the blue water, which was clear as crystal, and saw
hundreds of fish gathering about the keel, darting hither
and thither, and glistening with all the colours of the
rainbow as the rays of light fell upon them at different
angles. The smaller ones would get out of the way of
the larger; <i>seniores priores</i> is the rule among the inhabitants
of the deep. Absorbed in the contemplation
of these creatures, that have ever interested me above
all others, and wondering at the productiveness of these
warm seas, and at the survival of a species always at
war with each other, I did not at first notice that the
captain was speaking to me.
</p>

<p>
He wanted to introduce me to one of the residents,
whose name and face were equally familiar to me, and
who turned out to be an old fellow-student, who had
joined the Madras army and had been shunted with
part of his regiment to this out-of-the-way place.
</p>

<p>
Considering that those were the halcyon days ere
locomotion had carried the now ubiquitous British
tourist to every nook and corner of the habitable globe,
it was indeed a strange coincidence to encounter an old
friend in the neighbourhood of the Mergui Archipelago,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
which not one out of a thousand at home had ever
heard of; or if they had, the name had described that
overland route across the brain, which is not uncommonly
followed by the subjects taught at school.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, of course, progress is setting its stamp
upon all <i>five</i> quarters of the globe; the beautiful names
of Jones, Brown, Smith or “Arry” may be seen carved
on the Pyramids of Egypt; on the costly marble of
the Taj at Agra; on the Pagoda at Rangoon; and will
ere long doubtless ornament the giant trees in “Darkest
Africa,” to the astonishment of the Pigmies!
</p>

<p>
“<i>Cœlum non animum mutant</i>, etc...,” and whether
in his own beloved Epping Forest, or in a tropical
jungle, he will ferret out nature’s gems and destroy them;
and in both places the course of his peregrinations
may be traced by empty beer bottles and greasy sandwich
papers.
</p>

<p>
The proprietor of an estate on the Dorset coast,
which was laid out for the convenience of the public,
went so far as to supply printed quotations from various
authors, and a special tablet for the names of visitors,
but the latter remained black, while the rocks around
were deeply scored in every conceivable direction.
Such conduct can only be accounted for on the Darwinian
theory, for the bump of mischief is unquestionably
more developed in the apes than in any other
animal.
</p>

<p>
I invariably pencil under such names “sentenced for
felony to penal servitude for life!” or some equally
agreeable sentence, which may, or may not, have the
desired effect. I was likewise struck when visiting
Stratford-on-Avon, and <i>the</i> house there many years ago,
by the custodian requesting that we should not write
our names, or even initials, anywhere about the room
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
in which the poet for all time is said to have first seen
the light.
</p>

<p>
The injunction was doubly superfluous; in the first
place, my friends and self were not in the habit of
publishing ourselves in this most objectionable manner;
and secondly, even if so minded, we could not have
found a clear space for any one of our names!
</p>

<p>
Any encounter with a face not seen for many years,
is sure to touch the spring of recollection and set
in motion the machinery of the past. Pacing the
deck, we wandered once more over the well-trodden
road of the past, recalling notable episodes, and conjecturing
where sundry of our fellow-students might
even then be fighting the battle of life.
</p>

<p>
Just as we had arrived at the conclusion, not uncommonly
held by young men in respect of themselves,
that nothing on earth was good enough for us, we were
joined by the captain, who held in his hand an
invitation for himself and me to dine and sleep
ashore.
</p>

<p>
We accepted the invitation and entrusted the missive
to my friend.
</p>

<p>
Rather nervous as to the limited state of my wardrobe,
and hoping that our entertainers would be the
reverse of hypercritical, I went ashore at the appointed
time in the captain’s gig, and we found a considerable
party of ladies and gentlemen already assembled to
meet us. The dinner had evidently been got up in
the captain’s honour, and it was on a par with his
usual thoughtfulness to get his guest included in his
own invitation.
</p>

<p>
To the relief of all parties, the ceremony of introductions
was duly accomplished, and we adjourned to
dinner, the same ordeal as elsewhere, but reflecting in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
this instance unbounded credit on their Madrassee
cook. It was undeniably a very pleasant evening, one
of the most sociable I can look back upon. Many of
their faces I can see before me still, the names, alas!
have become effaced.
</p>

<p>
One of the topics of conversation was the variety and
profusion of orchids in the primeval forest close at
hand; and, particularly struck by the apathy with
which everyone seemed to mention these choicest of
Nature’s gems, I inwardly resolved to be off to the
forest early next morning and bring back a load of the
rarest kinds I could lay hands on.
</p>

<p>
Waking at an early hour, I partook of some tea and
toast, and sallied forth with my gun, which I had
brought ashore, and—the wherewith to indulge in a
smoke, if so inclined.
</p>

<p>
The station was composed of a few bungalows
built on rising ground along the sea front; behind
which intervened a strip of cultivated land, and then
one arrived at the edge of the mighty forest. The
dividing belt of open ground having been under rice,
was now dry and hard; and I consequently traversed
it in a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
As in the affairs of life generally, my eagerness
in this instance to secure the coveted orchids had
entirely warped my judgment; otherwise I should have
taken counsel with those proficient in local topography,
and should have brought with me a couple of Burmese
with hatchets and bamboo ladders.
</p>

<p>
Walking was easy enough owing to the total absence
of undergrowth, and fairly pleasant on the springy bed
of leaves, which had accumulated there for untold
ages; while overhead the impenetrable lacework of
massive branches completely shut out the sun, leaving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
almost indescribable gloom and darkness all around
me. On looking up, I could see huge branches literally
covered with the unrivalled parasites, their colours
exceedingly varied and delicate, and their leaves greener
and more spotless than I had ever yet seen.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, one grave fault to be found with
all of them—they were far beyond my reach! It was
horribly tantalizing; but hoping to find others at a
lower elevation, I plunged deeper into the forest and—lost
my way.
</p>

<p>
I came to the conclusion that I might fare worse if I
went any further, so I turned back.
</p>

<p>
I have already lost my way once in these pages,
so I shall find it again now as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, my wanderings to that end were far
from pleasant. I deeply regretted not having told
even the “bearer” whither I was going. The place
began to have a terrible fascination for me; on that
soft carpet, I reflected that any uncouth beast might
creep upon me unawares; while I began to scan the
branches now, not for orchids, but for pythons, which I
almost fancied I could see, hanging down and surveying
me with their hard, lustreless eyes.
</p>

<p>
Nay, I refrained from firing a shot, by way of signal
to a possible search-party, from fear of awakening such
monsters from their normal state of lethargy.
</p>

<p>
At last, after about five hours’ wandering, I emerged
into a sun, which at first almost blinded me.
</p>

<p>
My absence was beginning to cause some anxiety
at the house where I was staying; and at breakfast,
which had been put off on my account, I had to make
a clean breast of everything.
</p>

<p>
I was reminded by my hostess, that, besides the
necessity of taking natives on such an expedition, it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
would also have been more prudent to have taken a
few grains of quinine—of which I now swallowed five,
at her express solicitation—before setting foot in a
place known to be deadly, owing to pent-up malaria.
And this was why the orchids were left to waste their
beauties on the forest air and blush unseen!
</p>

<p>
I saw but little of the native stockade, which, if my
memory serves me right, stood on a kind of delta, some
way from the European quarters. The inhabitants led
a peaceful existence; the sea supplied them with quantities
of fish, which were dried for export; the land
with timber and “tuskers,” the latter very valuable for
their ivory. Pearls too were by no means rare, though
not fished under any organized system.
</p>

<p>
Some of the islands further south are, I believe,
several thousand feet in height and extremely volcanic;
but I had to refuse the only offer to see them that was
ever made to me. A few hours after our arrival,
another and larger steamer put in an appearance <i>en
route</i> to the Andamans.
</p>

<p>
I was offered a passage; a tempting proposition, but
which had to be declined.
</p>

<p>
Besides being averse to leaving my host so abruptly,
in short, making a convenience of him, I had to consider
the scanty state of my wardrobe—I had left nearly
everything at Moulmein, and the still lower ebb of my
funds. Pay was very small in those days, while the
bulk of what I received had to be remitted home
forthwith. Fortunately the rate of exchange was then
about par; what my position would have been under
the present abnormally low rate, I tremble to think.
</p>

<p>
Having been thoroughly cleared out by the Mutiny,
I found myself severely handicapped by having to support
a wife and child at home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Some folks, dazzled by the brilliant prospects of the
Indian Service, refuse to see the reverse side of the
medal; but they should take into consideration the fact
that on retirement with, say a colonel’s pension of 365<i>l.</i>,
60<i>l.</i> is deducted towards the Widows’ and Orphan’s
Pensions Fund, the same amount as he has paid for
years from his full pay.
</p>

<p>
The accounts are never published, never go beyond
the sacred precincts of the India Office, so we must take
it on trust, that the funds could not be maintained in
any other way. The calculation of what an officer has
paid at this rate for forty years, with donations, interest,
etc., would make the mouth of many an insurance
agent water!
</p>

<p>
For the reasons already mentioned, I elected to
return by the way I had come, and had no reason to
regret doing so. What if I did not see the Andaman
Islands! they were places of little or no interest. A
curse seemed to have rested on them. To begin with,
their original inhabitants were few and far between;
wretched specimens of humanity, at least morally and
intellectually, if not physically; differing from anything
I had been accustomed to—Cannibals! Upon
this promising soil we then grafted the noblest types of
the scum of India—mutineers, murderers and Dacoits.
That is to say, we focused on one spot all that was
worse than cannibalism, there to dream of vengeance,
and pass the remainder of their lives feeding on their
dire hatred of mankind in general, and every other
passion likely to convert them into incarnate devils, ten
times worse than they had been before. Many were
sent there because they attempted to recover their
country from the iron rule of the usurper; others,
because they acted up to the teachings of their childhood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Could we but form an idea of the evil passions which
surged up in the bosoms of those Asiatics torn by
force from their own land, I believe that even Dante’s
immortal conception of the Inferno would pale its
ineffectual fire before that seething cauldron of pent-up
human rage. Before the advent of these horrors, the
islands, even if we throw cannibalism into the balance,
must have been infinitely better than our convict
system has since made them.
</p>

<p>
That such a distinct race of people should have been
confined to these islands, part of the same chain as
included the Nicobars, Sumatra and Java, was also
passing strange. The researches of Prichard and
Latham point to the origin of the various human types
from a single pair, the differences being due to the influence
of climate, food and a variety of other circumstances;
and if this was the case, the divergence of the
Andamanese from Malay characteristics, considering
their geographical proximity, is still more unaccountable.
But other ethnologists—Camper of the Dutch
school, the originator of the <i>facial angle</i> test of intelligence;
Blumenbach of the vertical system; and Morton
of American fame—incline to the belief in separate
origins and subsequent fusion by intercommunication.
</p>

<p>
Science has yet much to account for in this direction.
</p>

<p>
Such a late breakfast brought the time of departure
very near, as the captain was anxious to leave as early
as possible that afternoon. As it was, he had to account
for several hours’ delay, and would be taken to task for
any such unnecessarily indulged in. We therefore took
leave of our hospitable entertainers, and commenced the
return voyage to Moulmein, with no other passenger on
board than myself. He soon reminded me of my promise
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
regarding the merchant’s experience on the island,
and I gratified his curiosity, narrating the facts
much as they have been here set forth. Moulmein
was “made” in due time; and I was heartily sorry to
bid farewell to the captain, who had to proceed straight
to Calcutta, whereas my steamer would follow in the
wake of the <i>Pluto</i> ten days later. I was glad of the
respite, being moreover in no hurry to change the clear,
bright Salween for the muddy, depressing Hooghly,
with its defunct Hindoos and carrion fowl.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving Moulmein, I consulted with my friend
as to some suitable way of tendering my thanks to the
captain for all the kindness and hospitality I had
received at his hands; and a plan was devised and carried
out on my return to India. This, while insignificant
in intrinsic value, served as a slight <i>souvenir</i> of the
time when he had done all in his power to render the
voyage as comfortable and interesting as possible, and
to wean me from brooding over the recent Cimmerian
period of the Mutiny. For some time we corresponded.
If he still lives, may we meet again on this side of the
border!

<h2>
CHAPTER XX.
<br />
AND LAST.
</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">“My pen is at the bottom of a page,</p>
<p>Which being finished, here the story ends</p>
<p>’Tis to be wished it had been sooner done,</p>
<p>But stories somehow lengthen when begun.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
The reader may mentally alter the title of this concluding
chapter to “<i>At</i> Last!” and if he has found my
reminiscences dull or humdrum, he will soon have his
reward by closing the book and consigning it to oblivion—or
to Mudie’s cart!
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, in glancing back over the foregoing
pages—a retrospect of a retrospect—I seem to have
fulfilled what I undertook at the outset—even though
that be little.
</p>

<p>
Digressions there are, I know, “innumerable as the
temples in Pagan,” to borrow an old Burmese proverb;
and the bare outline of my story, stripped of such
embellishments, might easily be reduced to the dimensions
of a certain celebrated signboard, which set forth
the fame of one John Thompson.
</p>

<p>
That worthy man, a hatter by trade, composed it
himself as follows: “<i>John Thompson, hatter; makes
and sells hats for ready money</i>,” under which was
depicted a large hat. This he submitted to half a dozen
cronies, who modified it as follows. The first thought
the word “hatter” unnecessary, because followed by
the words “makes hats.” It was therefore struck out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
The next objected to the word “makes,” as no one, he
argued, would care who made the hats, as long as they
were good. That was also omitted.
</p>

<p>
A third found fault with the expression “sells,” as no
one imagined for a moment that he gave them away.
“Sells,” therefore, followed the fate of its predecessors.
Another took exception at “hats,” in consideration of
the painting underneath. Hats was accordingly obliterated.
</p>

<p>
The fifth condemned the clause referring to ready
money, since that was the custom of the place; while
the sixth and last, vexed beyond measure at finding
nothing left to erase, would have pulled the signboard
down bodily, but for the remonstrances of the
others.
</p>

<p>
To resume the beginning of the end.
</p>

<p>
The business in teak-wood was now drawing to a close,
for ere long the rains would cease, and there would no
longer be any means of floating the timber down to the
coast on the swollen tributaries of the Salween. Few
vessels therefore remained, and the river looked deserted,
but for an unusually large craft painted white, and
therefore conspicuous in more ways than one.
</p>

<p>
She proved, on inquiry, to be an American vessel of
considerable burden, chartered for the purpose of transporting
elephants to Bengal; and as she was anchored
in mid-stream, we went off to watch the process of
embarking the invaluable creatures.
</p>

<p>
They were brought from the shore one by one on
stout rafts, on which they behaved with the utmost
decorum, evidently in blissful ignorance of their ultimate
destination—the ship’s hold. If they thought about it
at all, it was merely a case of transferring them to the
opposite bank of the river, a proceeding frequently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
indulged in. The raft was then made fast to the further
side of the ship; and some specially constructed gear
was next lowered from a crane on the yard arm, and
the elephant was slung in the broad leather bands
attached to massive chains. Being accustomed to the
“howdah” and belly bands, no notice was taken of this;
but as soon as they found themselves hoisted off their
feet and suspended in mid-air, mere words would fail to
describe their puzzled expression.
</p>

<p>
On first rising, they trumpeted loudly, but as they
reached greater altitudes, all power of uttering even
a protest seemed to desert them, and anything more
ludicrous I never beheld.
</p>

<p>
The tackle had been made very powerful, the average
weight of the large elephants being calculated; but to
guard against any possible mishap, the rafts were removed
as soon as the pachyderms were fairly “under weigh,” so
that, had the worst come to the worst, they would only
have fallen into the water and swum ashore. When clear
of the ship’s side, they were swung round until exactly
over the main hold, and then lowered. Sometimes a
foot would be planted on the combings; but a gentle
tap from a capstan bar soon removed the impediment,
and the leviathan disappeared below, there to be cabin’d,
crib’d, confined, and ere long tossed about in the Bay
of Bengal. I forget the exact number shipped on this
occasion; but believe it was not far short of ninety, all
fine, large animals, very different to anything ever seen
in this country, not excepting the late lamented “Jumbo.”
</p>

<p>
It was impossible not to think of the pitiable condition
of these poor beasts, should anything like bad
weather overtake the ship out at sea: while the condition
of the hold must have been anything but savoury
at the best of times; and indeed the effluvia arising
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
thence during the process of embarking robbed me of
all desire to inspect their quarters.
</p>

<p>
They were, I believe, arranged in rows, a position in
which they could afford each other some support during
the varied movements of the ship; while they were
further helped through the ordeal by their great stability
in circumference of legs and feet, and the long, prehensile
trunks, with which they could hold on to any
convenient stanchions.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, on inquiring soon after our arrival at Calcutta,
we learnt that they had all arrived safely and in good
condition, so that they must be far better sailors than
horses. Anything like mutiny in the hold might have led
to serious consequences, considering that each animal
was ten feet high, weighed about five tons, and possessed
strength centred, according to Cuvier, in 40,000 muscles
with a distinct or combined action, according to circumstances!
Well, a panic ensuing among these monsters
in the hold, numbering from fifty to ninety, would have
been a scene of indescribable terror, besides probably
occasioning the foundering of the ship and the loss of
something between 12,000<i>l.</i> and 22,000<i>l.</i> in cargo alone,
the average commercial value of such elephants being
250<i>l.</i> apiece.
</p>

<p>
When that widespread epidemic of elephant-mania
broke out in England some years ago on account of
“Jumbo,” who does not remember the sickening details
of the ridiculous offerings at his shrine, and the no less
idiotic fuss made over the paraphernalia for removing
one such animal a few miles by land! Why, his
“mahout” would have ridden him from the Zoo to the
Docks in an hour at dead of night, and then walked
him on board! Such things are managed differently in
the East.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The process of embarking the elephants had such a
fascination for me, that I should, if alone, in all probability
have remained on board for the rest of the day.
My friend, however, felt the pangs of hunger and
insisted on returning. Dear old fellow! after nearly
completing his career in India, without even the
semblance of illness, he slipped from some vehicle and
thereby contracted a troublesome malady which soon
carried him off. He was a good husband, father, friend
and doctor, regretted by all who knew him: and I have
many a time stood by his grave near Cheltenham and
thought of the pleasant times we had spent together in
far-off climes, this trip in particular.
</p>

<p>
The distance intervening between Moulmein and the
sea had already displayed to our admiring gaze some of
the beauties of the well-wooded banks of the Salween;
but an excellent opportunity now presented itself for
exploring further up.
</p>

<p>
The Commissioner being about to start an inspection
duty in his steam yacht, and very sensibly preferring
company to solitude, organized a picnic party, in
which I had the honour to be included. The affair was
to be a kind of picnic by land and water, affording time
to land at various places, with the performance of certain
official duties, thus combining business with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
The commissariat devolved on the chief’s wife, and,
with the assistance of a native cook, certainly acquitted
herself admirably—such mulligatawny, and
such salads! The scene on either side, as the river
gradually narrowed, was very beautiful. From the
wooded heights in the background, a bright pagoda
peeped out here and there among vegetation more profuse
and luxuriant than any I had ever seen since my
journey on the Pegu river.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We visited several of the villages, which were very
neat and built, as usual, on piles; but we soon discovered
that distance lent enchantment to the view, and
that a closer acquaintance brought us in contact with a
formidable amalgamation of odours, not of the eau-de-Cologne
order, a <i>mélange</i> of Jack-fruit, mango, and that
curious native delicacy, to which I alluded in a former
chapter, and which consists for the most part of fish not
remarkable for its freshness!
</p>

<p>
While their houses were canopied with the thickest of
foliage, the space around was kept clear of anything
like undergrowth. Only a few bamboos were allowed
to grow in each clump, about which a man could thread
his way with ease. The survivors were consequently of
large size—the largest I ever came across—the specimens
cut for us as <i>souvenirs</i> measuring nine inches in
diameter. Three joints of such a one I took back to
Calcutta, one of which I had prettily carved for a
present, while the others served as wine-coolers. The
price asked by the natives for a bamboo sixty or
seventy feet in length, including the cost of cutting up,
was not exorbitant, amounting to about four annas, or
sixpence. The dexterity with which it was levelled
and cut up was almost unequalled, reminding one—ghastly
reminiscence!—of the manner in which a
Ghoorka handled his <i>kookerie</i>, when cutting off the
heads of his prisoners. I once witnessed thirty severed
in a row; and there was no keeping the bloodthirsty
little demons from so disposing of their captives.
</p>

<p>
The Jack-fruit and plantain both revelled in that
fertile soil, attaining to a large size; but as for the
mango—oh, what a falling off was there! not off the
trees, but in point of size and flavour. The ubiquitous
crow of course abounded; paroquets flew away uttering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
discordant shrieks; and squirrels gambolled from bough
to bough, running up and down the stems spiral wise.
</p>

<p>
Extremely picturesque were the costumes of the men
and women squatting about in front of their dwellings,
and especially the artistic way in which the latter coiled
their jet-black hair and embellished it with flowers of a
waxy appearance.
</p>

<p>
It certainly occurred to me that here, of all places on
earth, the inhabitants ought to be happy and contented;
nature had lavished her choicest gifts on them in such
profusion, leaving them but little in the way of arduous
occupation. Perhaps they were happy; they certainly
seemed so, for all were well dressed, and I do not
remember seeing a single beggar. And, from a knowledge
of both, I should say that such simple villagers
have a much better chance of present and future happiness
than the inhabitants of some of our own villages,
where for the most part the Christian virtues seem conspicuous
by their absence.
</p>

<p>
Living in one for seven years in a private capacity,
my services, in virtue of my profession, were nevertheless
very frequently asked for and given, and I consequently
saw a great deal of their inner life, which often
startled and shocked me.
</p>

<p>
With all respect to General Booth, “Darkest England”
exists in the rural districts, and not in London,
where are centred the wealth, enterprise, benevolence
and clerical power of the land. The country, on the
other hand, remains in the shadow of death; and there
stands the vineyard that requires labourers, who work
to please their Master, and not merely for the loaves and
fishes!
</p>

<p>
The party consisted of three or four married couples,
a young unmarried lady and myself, a grass-widower of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
some eighteen months’ standing. Naturally, we two
were thrown together during the day, and just as
naturally we were accused of flirting. It was therefore
with extreme concern that I attended to my torch,
remembering my mishap in the same neighbourhood
on a former occasion, as we presently explored some
very pretty caves, which, for a reason which geologists
may be able to explain, especially abound on the right
bank.
</p>

<p>
This time, I reflected I was not alone, and if my
torch were to go out, of course no one would believe
that it was the result of accident. So at least I concluded,
mindful of the proverbial charity that folks at
large indulge in when criticizing their neighbours’
proceedings.
</p>

<p>
After lunch on the yacht, temptingly laid out and
thoroughly appreciated, the boat’s head was turned, and
we quietly steamed down to Moulmein. The day was
full of interest from start to finish, and everyone
thoroughly enjoyed it.
</p>

<p>
Something of the old schoolboy sensation, when his
fleeting holidays are drawing to a close, stole over me
as our steamer turned up a few days later to convey us
back to a land associated with so many painful
memories. Before the Mutiny, I could count my friends
by scores; now most of them had perished, slaughtered
with few exceptions by their own men in whom they
reposed such blind and ill-requited confidence. Many
of the old landmarks of the service were also to be
swept away, and new ones set up in their place.
</p>

<p>
The prospect was uninviting to a degree; but as I
could not afford to cut the painter for good and all, I
had to make the best of a bad bargain. At any rate,
we were, under our old masters, content and happy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
and should have been prosperous as well, but for an
event, for which those at home were more to blame
than the people on the spot.
</p>

<p>
What were the chances of improvement now, with
more home interference on the part of those who
knew not the East? Time alone could show! I had
certainly enjoyed myself, and in some measure my
Burmese trip had done me good; but now the reaction
was setting in, and I began to question whether it
would not have been better after all to have stayed on
the spot and lived down the disagreeables. Hard
work is without a doubt the best panacea for all
manner of troubles; and not, as so many aver, an
unceasing round of pleasure and fictitious excitement.
</p>

<p>
My feelings had partaken very much of the same
character as those of a party of young children I once
upon a time escorted to their first seaside holiday,
and then brought back after a month’s enjoyment of
the indescribable delights which any of our watering
places afford such juveniles. Going, they were all
sunshine and excitement, never ceasing to prattle about
their coming excursions and amusements, and even
setting the other occupants of the carriage in a roar of
laughter by their ingenuous attempts to pronounce the
dreadful Welsh names of the stations through which
we passed.
</p>

<p>
Very different was the return journey; all was dark
without and sad within; hardly a word spoken from
beginning to end; stations unnoticed and uncared for,
and even the “goodies” eaten in silence.
</p>

<p>
And I felt sad too at the prospect of returning to
India. For a time, I was diverted by the fatiguing
process of packing; though it was only by the aid of a
zealous and painstaking domestic, who ignored the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
mosquitoes and the exertion, that I finally succeeded in
stowing away all the vases, teapots, cups and saucers,
heathen gods and goddesses, bamboos, etc., regretting
the while that I had ever been prevailed upon to buy
them. I was therefore not sorry at having failed to
secure a couple of Pegu ponies for transmission to
India. Their price alone—Rs. 300 for an animal that
formerly cost one-tenth of that price—placed me out of
the ring; and the trouble and expenses attendant on
the transport of live stock must have been considerable.
As a speculation, it might have answered; but whatever
gifts Nature may have lavished broadcast upon me, the
bump of “barter” was only developed in a very rudimentary
state. After packing came the still more
painful operation of leave-taking, and we were soon
steaming down the river for the last time. Several
handkerchiefs waving from a verandah grew less distinct,
until a bend in the stream hid them from view.
</p>

<p>
We were taken back by the same adventurous,
independent captain, a buoyant person of the Mark
Tapley order, who gave us one more proof of his
undeniable force of will. We had reached the Sand
Heads, about a hundred and twenty miles from
Calcutta, when a dispute arose as to whether we should
be up in time to land that evening. Two circumstances
militated strongly against us, the strength of the outward
current and the rule that forbade any navigation after
sunset among the shipping that lay off the town. But
the captain swore he would be ashore in time to dine
with his wife; and he kept his word. The wheels
revolved faster, the wave of cleavage rose higher; and
the inquiries of the engineer were ever met with “Give
her as much more as you can!” As the daylight began
to ebb, the smell of fire was distinctly perceptible, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
smoke was issuing from various chinks. A number of
Lascars too might be seen emptying buckets over the
deck. Still the captain kept his course; and at last,
the observed of all observers, we passed the shipping
and reached our moorings, and were at rest.
</p>

<p>
I took a boat and went ashore, and——Chaos came
again!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<p>For additional contact information:</p>

    Chief Executive and Director<br />
    gbnewby@pglaf.org</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
